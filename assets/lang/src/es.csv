This level of land protection is great...a good start.,,,,,,
Maybe we ought to consider stepping it up a bit?,,,,,,
But quite a lot of land is still left exposed.,,,,,,
I'm happy that there's more outdoors for me to hike in and enjoy :),,,,,,

I just hope the eco-freaks don't try to ban cows next.,,,,,,
It's vital for each generation to discover its mission and to fight for it!,,,,,,
My recycling posters were inspired by Neurath's isotypes. Where would we be today without him!,,,,,,

"It was a major effort, but it will be worthwhile. AMR might kill ten million people a year.",,,,,,
It would be better if we addressed the causes of AMR by shrinking the industrial livestock industry and improving living standards in the Global South...,,,,,,
We have taken over the global parliament and sent the legislators home.,,,,,,
The revolution that overthrew capitalism was not so long ago.,,,,,,
They can rise up again.,,,,,,
You will be able to pass any laws you want by decree.,,,,,,
"Yet, the people are seething underneath your boot.",,,,,,
We've seen a modest boost in crop yields from this new infrastructure.,,,,,,
"Strangely, we keep getting emails from the spinach saying they want 10x as much nitrogen than necessary.",,,,,,
Well the mining initiative was a success!,,,,,,
"We've tapped into enough tritium to cover our fusion needs for, well, forever as far as I can tell.",,,,,,

Most have reported it as an improvement in their quality of life.,,,,,,
"It's a lot quieter, and the fresh air has done wonders for me.",,,,,,
Organic and fossil-free agriculture requires more labor than industrial farming.,,,,,,
You hear that?,,,,,,
...just the sweet hum of electricity.,,,,,,
"No more roaring and rattling of engines, the sputtering and belching of combustion...",,,,,,
...music to my ears.,,,,,,
I love watching old shows that I've already seen a dozen times.,,,,,,
Something about it makes me feel comforted by the nostalgia.,,,,,,
Droughts aren't nearly as devastating as they once were thanks to these new varieties.,,,,,,

The elderly folks in my town love hanging out around the drop off facilities making sure people put the correct recyclables in the right bin.,,,,,,
"We don't put people in cages anymore, so why do we still think it's ok for animals?",,,,,,
I say good riddance to those horrendous institutions of suffering.,,,,,,
"It was quite the undertaking, and an incredibly complex project, but it was worth it in the end.",,,,,,
"I can sleep soundly tonight knowing that no animal is at risk of being hunted, whether by humans or by other animals.",,,,,,
We've been able to collect much more dynamic data about how the Earth is changing after establishing new kinds of studies.,,,,,,
"The city air feels fresher somehow, you know?",,,,,,
...and these new systems are clogging up the roads and make driving a pain.,,,,,,
(even though I don't use it myself),,,,,,
Well I'm all for public transit...,,,,,,
Communities affected most by highway infrastructure are experiencing less air pollution and increased health.,,,,,,
I guess less people are driving now that public transit is so convenient.,,,,,,
I feel way less guilty about eating meat now!,,,,,,
This is a bunch of incrementalist garbage!,,,,,,

"The rotting algae formed anoxic dead zones on the abyssal plains, killing much ocean life...",,,,,,
"The abundance of diatoms not only sequestered carbon, but fed millions of salmon fry and other marine life. This was a great success!",,,,,,
"I suppose iron wasn't a major limiting nutrient, because the blooms of diatoms are rather minor.",,,,,,
Back to the drawing board!,,,,,,
"Demilitarization resulted in a significant drop in global emissions, as well as an increase in global outlook and untold tons of salvageable metals.",,,,,,
We're totally defenceless now...,,,,,,

We should go up to see his vineyard sometime.,,,,,,
It's nice to have resources directed towards our countries for once.,,,,,,
"Maybe not...but this is a gesture of good faith, at least.",,,,,,
Will it ever match the wealth that was stolen from us?,,,,,,
I don't think the planet can sustain it!,,,,,,
You do realize that not everyone can enjoy a high standard of living?,,,,,,
What are you doing?,,,,,,
...this kind of regression isn't necessary..,,,,,,
"...with the right technology and conditions, no one has to give anything up...",,,,,,
"You're supposed to make things better, not worse!",,,,,,
It's about time that we recognize who the main perpetrators of all these crises are.,,,,,,
"With the restoration of the Satoyama forests, students and senior citizens work with farmers to plant rice and clear irrigation channels. ",,,,,,
We call ourselves the Matsutake Crusaders. Our co-op has been working together to condition the forest for Matsutake mushrooms to thrive again.,,,,,,
"So many more wonderful trees make habitats and store carbon, while still supporting food production.",,,,,,
How exciting!,,,,,,
I quite like working under the canopy...the shade's nice.,,,,,,
I thought I would hate the inconvenience of not being able to fly...,,,,,,
but who doesn't like trains?,,,,,,
"It may appear extreme to some, but sometimes you have to be a little tough with people to keep nature safe.",,,,,,
"Some people just don't know any better, you know what I mean?",,,,,,
"If we've still got to combust things for energy, this is at least an improvement.",,,,,,
Reducing energy consumption is an easy way to protect the grid and minimize environmental impact.,,,,,,
How can anyone survive on such a pathetic amount of energy?,,,,,,
Reducing,,,,,,
These restrictions have been ridiculous!,,,,,,
I'm sure I won't.,,,,,,
I've lived decently on less energy than this...I'm sure you'll get used to it.,,,,,,
"Wow, we've produced more than fourteen times the usual quota this year alone.",,,,,,
My back hurts from these long work hours. I hope it's worth it...,,,,,,
"We were able to bring back the passenger pigeon, but this quickly became an exotic poultry dish leading to its extinction again.",,,,,,
And now I'm getting a lot of requests to use this technology for designer dogs.,,,,,,
We succeeded in cloning some lost species and successfully re-introduced them into their original ecosystems.,,,,,,
Surprisingly there haven't been any major issues.,,,,,,
"We succeeded in cloning some lost species, but they all were either short-lived or could not survive in the wild.",,,,,,
So far we've seen a modest decrease in temperatures.,,,,,,
I don't know how long it will last though.,,,,,,
The temporary cooling has reversed.,,,,,,
We've shifted quite a lot of petroleum-based plastic to these new biofabrication methods.,,,,,,
"Still, we're at least introducing less new CO2 into the atmosphere by avoiding some fossil fuel usage.",,,,,,
But--even though we use far less plastic than we did pre-revolution--the amount of biomass available still isn't enough to fully replace petroleum-based plastics.,,,,,,
The high seas fishing ban has had benefits...,,,,,,
but they have been limited since less than 10% of global fish catch was on the high seas.,,,,,,
Maybe we ought to consider a blanket ban on industrial fishing?,,,,,,
We were able to capture the Davida asteroid and steer it within Earth's orbit and unleash a tremendous amount of lithium and rare earth metals.,,,,,,
...no doubt many evironmentally-destructive mining practices will become obsolete...,,,,,,
"I want my fresh local swordfish, tuna, lobster and crabmeat! ",,,,,,
Now I can't get any of it...,,,,,,
The hairy-nosed otter (Lutra sumatrana) has been seen again!,,,,,,
Otters are the best :),,,,,,
"Now a popular manga mascot, this rare otter represents hope and honor.",,,,,,
Biodiversity in the oceans is bouncing back!,,,,,,
We've seen recovery of old oyster beds and the return of massive schools of cod and sardines.,,,,,,
"More wolves, lions, cougars, and other large predators means more livestock have been attacked!",,,,,,
We've improved efficiency of this process and converted existing steel manufacturing facilities to use it.,,,,,,
"Fish aquaculture may have sustained seafood production, but it only shifted fishing pressure from large fish to smaller ones.",,,,,,
It also incubated new fish pathogens.,,,,,,
This new battery network will help a lot with large-scale electrification and improving reliability.,,,,,,
I think it's a great shame that eels and frogs don't get the same attention as polar bears and penguins.,,,,,,
Around 40 percent of all plant and animal species rely on these wetlands.,,,,,,
"Our slimy friends should be much happier now- along with geese, deer, and all the life in and around these wetlands.",,,,,,
"We've successfully built a space elevator, putting the stars one step closer.",,,,,,
"We're in a better position to expand space activities, if you so choose.",,,,,,
I'm so excited to try it out!,,,,,,
I found it surprisingly easy to cut meat out of my diet once a week.,,,,,,
"There are certain meals that feature meat that are important to me, and I would hate to lose them.",,,,,,
This feels like a slippery slope...,,,,,,
But cutting it out every once in awhile feels reasonable to me.,,,,,,
These last few years have been miserable.,,,,,,
This was long overdue!,,,,,,
"Sure, I get eating less meat, but banning it entirely?",,,,,,
You're mad with power--how was this a good idea?,,,,,,
Can't we just figure out more sustainable and ethical ways to produce meat?,,,,,,
"Did you know that green roofs can reflect up to 80% of the solar energy hitting it, back into space?? ",,,,,,
And it's nice to have an additional green space to enjoy.,,,,,,
I've noticed that my apartment's temperature is much more consistent now...,,,,,,
"My kids stopped complaining as much, at least.",,,,,,

The soil is richer than what I had before.,,,,,,
The ban on outdoor cats is going well.,,,,,,
Wild to think how much damage those critters can do!,,,,,,
" I agree, the battle to feed all of humanity is over.",,,,,,
It's wrong to lock people up in cages. As a socialist society we can do better than this!,,,,,,
"If you do this, don't expect help when you need some brute force to back you up...",,,,,,
Significant amounts of carbon were locked into human structures and wide-scale reforestation helped to buffer the ecological strain of increased logging.,,,,,,
"Significant amounts of carbon was locked into human structures, but the increase in logging put a serious strain on forest ecosystems.",,,,,,
Animal husbandry takes up far too much room! Hard trade-offs must be made.,,,,,,
A genetically altered strain of Nannochloropsis is able to produce a higher concentration of lipids for biofuel and butanol.,,,,,,
We can now grow and deploy algae-based biofuels at scale.,,,,,,
Adaptations like non-tillage and cover crops made a notable difference in terms of carbon and water retention in soil.,,,,,,

We were able to successfully develop the Ark and collect samples of a majority of the remaining species.,,,,,,
"We can now deploy fast-breeder reactors, which will help alleviate uranium shortages by burning spent nuclear waste. ",,,,,,
We were never able to overcome the reprocessing and fuel fabrication balance challenges. It's time to throw in the towel.,,,,,,
There are too many people living into old age and not enough young people to take care of them!,,,,,,
The gender ratio has shifted as people prefer to have girls rather than boys.,,,,,,
The mission was a success!,,,,,,
"I mean, I'm ambivalent on the whole fossil fuels thing, but I'm excited about further space expeditions.",,,,,,
I'm stoked I can spend 24/7 in space now!,,,,,,
...we can finally start moving all our dirty industry off-planet...,,,,,,
This will also be our launch pad to go deeper into space.,,,,,,

Now that the bike paths have improved it's much safer and more pleasant.,,,,,,
"And with how walkable cities have become, I don't even need to take my bike half the time.",,,,,,
It's amazing that we can now diagnose specialized issues like species decline in a matter of minutes instead of years.,,,,,,
"Well for example, our fish population had a sudden decline and we found that it was due to cooler temperatures attracting more predators in the area.",,,,,,
Our children will become the Prometheans of tomorrow!,,,,,,
"Whoa, I just had a vision...",,,,,,
...did you see it too?,,,,,,
It was so detailed...was it a message from beyond the stars?,,,,,,
"Waiting, waiting...",,,,,,
...still no response...,,,,,,
We weren't able to develop any consistent way of seeding clouds...,,,,,,
We managed to develop a decent method for cloud seeding.,,,,,,

I can't say no to rain on-demand,,,,,,
"It's not that we can make it rain on command, but we can nudge the probabilities in our favor.",,,,,,
"So many places are gradually becoming themselves again, after decades of exploitation and neglect.",,,,,,
It's a beautiful sight to behold.,,,,,,
"Maybe we should call burgers made from these cows ""low-methane burgers"" what do you think?",,,,,,

"While algae additives reduced enteric methane emissions from cattle farming, its effect was limited to the feedlot stage.",,,,,,
The uptick in seaweed farms has also increased pressure on coastal ecosystems.,,,,,,
Development of hydrogen technology led to fuel cell adaptations allowing much lighter electric aircraft.,,,,,,
Weight limitations of lithium batteries limited their ability to carry commercial aircraft long distances.,,,,,,
Desalination brine is getting pumped back into the ocean...,,,,,,
And desalination takes up a lot of power!,,,,,,
At least now we can irrigate our crops again.,,,,,,
This is a disaster.,,,,,,
Coastal species are not equipped to adjust to the immediate change in salinity caused by the release of brine into the area.,,,,,,
I think we've worked out the last kinks that prevented us from scaling up BECCS.,,,,,,
"Looks like I should start clearing some land, we're gonna need it for all those new tree plantations.",,,,,,
I love these new perennials...saves me a lot of work.,,,,,,
"Don't need to worry about replanting them every year, or messing up my soil...",,,,,,

A recent study compared siblings conceived before and after nearby oil spills and found that nearby oil spills double the neonatal mortality rate.,,,,,,
"Not only that, they also found that pollution is placing communities at heightened risk of kidney damage, as well as diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. ",,,,,,
"If we keep up the oil production, more and more communities are going to have to face this danger.",,,,,,
Dissolved nutrient levels at lakes and river deltas around the world have drastically improved.,,,,,,
"By designing efficient food systems and treating waste, we've brought the dead zones to life.",,,,,,
We haven't had a decent chocolate harvest for some time now...,,,,,,
"The world's gotten used to plentiful coffee and chocolate, but we may be returning to the time when they were inaccessible luxuries!",,,,,,
...coffee's not any better. Fewer and fewer places have the right growing conditions.,,,,,,
"A fungus has been spreading across Europe, killing 80% of ash trees.",,,,,,
The pathogen was able to spread rapidly due to the industrialization of the nursery trade in Europe.,,,,,,
"This has had a catastrophic impact since ash trees are a keystone species—insects, lichen, mollusks, and birds all rely on them.",,,,,,
Taking plants out of their native habitat and packing them in large quantities for container shipping is a recipe for the globalization of plant disease.,,,,,,
The algae farmers in Lake Chad and seaweed farmers in Jambiani have expanded their harvest and processing operation.,,,,,,
"For many generations, Kanembu women have passed from mother to daughter the traditional methods of harvesting spirulina from Lake Boudou Andja in Chad to make dihé.",,,,,,
They are now a major exporter of food grade algae and seaweed.,,,,,,
"It's a pressed cake of spirulina, sold in local markets and used as a sauce base. Kind of like a curry brick.",,,,,,
Pollinator populations are declining to dangerously low levels.,,,,,,
Crop yields have been a bit lower than expected...this might be why.,,,,,,
"Bees may be small, but they are a crucial part of modern farming!",,,,,,
Without them we wouldn't be able to produce nearly as many crops.,,,,,,
A collapse in pollinators will affect more than just crop yields.,,,,,,
We need to improve biodiversity and lower extinction pressures to avoid catastrophe.,,,,,,
"Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services!",,,,,,
The use of pesticides likely contributes to colony collapse disorder.,,,,,,
Regional borders are under attack now from people desperate to find refuge outside of their home regions.,,,,,,
...but they are escalating their tactics.,,,,,,
We're doing our best to maintain the border and prevent crossings...,,,,,,
Popular opinion is rapidly turning against you...,,,,,,
...maybe it's time to reconsider implementing hard borders?,,,,,,
Wildfires are growing in intensity and frequency.,,,,,,
"Many of the people effected are elderly and are not tech savy so they don't trust ""apps"". They think they are talking to a robot.",,,,,,
"People are suffering form PTSD from losing their homes, possessions, and pets. This is a mental health crisis!",,,,,,
So many others have had similar experiences.,,,,,,
They've ravaged countless communities across the globe.,,,,,,
A home I spent years making my own was gone in an instant...,,,,,,
How can anyone live like this?,,,,,,
"Finally, we can put that terrible past behind us.",,,,,,
"We changed, but hopefully not too late.",,,,,,
"What a weight lifted of our shoulders though, eh?",,,,,,
"I was helping out with a local remediation project, and we were clearing out some invasive plants that were upsetting the local ecosystem.",,,,,,
Turns out you can ferment them into a pretty nice refreshment!,,,,,,
Now I'm seeing everyone volunteer at remediation sites to see what they can brew up!,,,,,,
I've got a small restaurant because I love cooking for others.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Seems like it's becoming quite the food trend!,,,,,,
I sent some to a few other chefs and we ended up putting together a book of jellyfish recipes.,,,,,,
...,,,,,,
The other day a neighbor brought in a ton of jellyfish...I guess they're everywhere now.,,,,,,
Bye!,,,,,,
Hey!,,,,,,
They're extremists!,,,,,,
"Look, you look like someone who's more...reasonable than these other parties.",,,,,,
Otherwise I fear what they're going to take next.,,,,,,
"My party is joining your coalition, so we can keep them in check together.",,,,,,
The Consumerist is now an [ally] ally. The contentedness of upper-middle and upper income regions will recover more quickly.,,,,,,
"I'm a socialist, but these people are extreme!",,,,,,
Havana in the 1990s was the first city to experiment with urban farms at a mass scale in peacetime.,,,,,,
This is great news! This'll take some load off of other parts of the food system.,,,,,,
"We have space to grow food, have more greenery in the city, and have a new hobby!",,,,,,
Now it's spreading everywhere since cities starting planning to become car-free.,,,,,,
...but with all this extra space we began reclaiming plots for larger scale urban farming.,,,,,,
So far things are going well--we've been able to meet quite a bit of our own food needs.,,,,,,
"These communities will be more resilient to food supply problems, so that's one less thing to worry about.",,,,,,
"A massive heat dome has formed, trapping scorching air across a wide area.",,,,,,
"It's too early to say, but reports are estimating deaths in the tens of thousands.",,,,,,
You are *killing* me with these plans!,,,,,,
The Consumerist is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
I almost miss the days before the revolution.,,,,,,
My life has only gotten worse.,,,,,,
I won't let you drag me down with you!,,,,,,
"I wanted change, but this is ridiculous.",,,,,,
All national borders were dissolved soon after the revolution.,,,,,,
"Of course, regional inequities haven't vanished overnight, so regions are still distinct from one another.",,,,,,
Here you can gain some insight on those differences and learn more about each region.,,,,,,
Now the world is organized into regions.,,,,,,
"Feel free to browse a bit. When you're ready, head on back to the ""Plan"" tab.",,,,,,
Flooding is getting even worse than before.,,,,,,
"Even if people can move back into their homes, they'll suffer health consequences for it!",,,,,,
These floods are effecting millions of people and it's becoming impossible to live in some places.,,,,,,
Mold and mildew grow soon after flooding...,,,,,,
We'll have to raise taxes.,,,,,,
We've identified several leaks at nuclear storage sites.,,,,,,
"It should be resolved soon, but I'm sure it will shake people's confidence in our nuclear program.",,,,,,
"We're dealing with it now, but the leaks have contaminated the subsurface and are threatening nearby water resources.",,,,,,
This is bad. A collapse this large and the displacement of that much water will surely have other effects.,,,,,,
"Did you know there is evidence that the Sinai once was green – as recently as 4,500 to 8,000 years ago. Cave paintings found there depict trees and plants! ",,,,,,
We've gotten lots of opposition to our cloud brightening scheme from island nations.,,,,,,
The temporary cooling has reversed.,,,,,,
"People have their heads in the clouds... we can stop this program, but geoengineering must go on.",,,,,,
"Higher temperatures have altered soil microbial ecology, causing additional carbon to be released.",,,,,,
That'll just make things hotter...you can see where this is going.,,,,,,
Crop yields are taking a hit because of that grey shroud we have around our planet.,,,,,,
"The solar radiation management initiative is upsetting my plants! They like sun, ya know.",,,,,,
" Our inspiration for the second moon is a French artist, who imagined a necklace of mirrors circling the Earth to illuminate the nighttime streets of Paris with reflected sunshine.",,,,,,
Water just isn't doing what it used to. Some places are seeing torrential rainfall become commonplace...,,,,,,
I'm sure you can guess what you need to do...,,,,,,
...but bring down the temperature anomaly and I bet we'll see this get better.,,,,,,
...so flooding is becoming more frequent and more severe.,,,,,,
The aragonite saturation horizon has risen to subsume virtually the entire Southern Ocean and encroached miles toward coasts around the world.,,,,,,
Molluscs like pteropods that form the basis of marine food webs are quite literally dissolving.,,,,,,
You can't just transition to renewables and do all of your restoration projects in whatever neighborhood you want! I'm not going to endure blackouts just because of your novel ideas.,,,,,,
You're going to regret this...,,,,,,
Big news--a proof for P = NP has been discovered.,,,,,,
At the least we'll be able to speed up our research across the board!,,,,,,
"I'll spare you the details, but suffice to say this will help greatly in all sorts of applications.",,,,,,
"National parks are beautiful, but are taking up land a lot of land these days. ",,,,,,
We'll have much less land for food—especially livestock—are you sure conservation is worth the cost?,,,,,,
I heard there were storms like this is my great grandfather's time.,,,,,,
"As I see it, we have two options. Either expand our agricultural lands at the expense of wilderness or try other kinds of farming.",,,,,,
Yields have peaked and they'll decline.,,,,,,
The soil just is blown away because we've ruined the land.,,,,,,
"Industrial agriculture gives us high yields, but it's like mining the soil.",,,,,,
"Pesticides, fertilizer, and irrigation each take their toll.",,,,,,
About nearly half of global farmland is degraded and we're still losing top soil every year.,,,,,,
"First the Great Barrier Reef, and now the very last coral has bleached.",,,,,,
I don't know if we can bring them back...,,,,,,
...but at the very least we can prevent something like this from happening again.,,,,,,
"Holy Moly, we're running out of viable petroleum reserves. It will be gone in twenty years, I reckon.",,,,,,
"They're controversial, but will ensure we have plenty oil for our energy needs.",,,,,,
Or...you could open up non-conventional oil sources.,,,,,,
Either cut down your energy-use or find another source of energy fast.,,,,,,
"To keep up oil production firms have pushed deeper into remote regions, often in Indigenous territory.",,,,,,
"Indigenous peoples have proven effective in blockading new pipelines and projects, lowering production. ",,,,,,
I'm getting reports of a novel mosquito-borne disease spreading quickly.,,,,,,
They've always been troublesome parasites--malaria kills hundreds of thousands of people per year--but in many parts of the world they weren't considered more than a nuisance.,,,,,,
Now they're much more dangerous.,,,,,,
"Warmer temperatures have been a boon for mosquito populations, so it was only a matter of time before this happened.",,,,,,
Reports of strange lights in the skies are coming in from all over the world.,,,,,,
What could it mean?,,,,,,
We've hit a nice milestone today!,,,,,,
"Of course, regions still trade food here and there for varieties that can't grow at home.",,,,,,
But now people have a more direct connection to the food they eat than they ever have.,,,,,,
Most of the world is self-sufficient in crop production. I never thought I'd see the day.,,,,,,
{region} has seceded from Gosplant.,,,,,,
This is a major blow to Gosplant...,,,,,,
...but maybe we'll survive it.,,,,,,
They felt neglected by your decision-making and lost all confidence in your capacity as planner.,,,,,,
"With the loss of animals that disperse seeds and rapid warming, plants have been unable to migrate at the pace necessary to adapt to climate change.",,,,,,
We must reorganize our society to use less land for agriculture and emit less carbon ... we have to cut down on meat.,,,,,,
"In addition, large areas of grass and shrub land have become inhospitable to the plants that once inhabited them.",,,,,,
Water stress has gotten totally out of hand.,,,,,,
Extreme rations have been implemented.,,,,,,
The area around the Niger Delta was brought to the edge of total destruction from unrestrained oil production.,,,,,,
"Thankfully, shutting down the oil industry and restoring the environment have done wonders for the region.",,,,,,
Populations of red colobus and pygmy hippos have bounced back. Local inhabitants are also much healthier and happier than before.,,,,,,
Heatwaves are becoming even more frequent and intense.,,,,,,
It's absolutely unbearable in some regions. We really can only reasonably live within a fairly limited range of temperatures.,,,,,,
We need to get things under control...I fear what may happen if we don't.,,,,,,
A nuclear power plant had a criticality accident last night.,,,,,,
The more reactors we have the more common these disasters will become.,,,,,,
"We're doing our best to contain the damage, but a lot of radiation was released in the explosion.",,,,,,
But we'll work quickly and do what we can.,,,,,,
...you've been doing great as planner...,,,,,,
...I feel like we're on the same wavelength...,,,,,,
The Accelerationist is now an [ally] ally. [research] Research points cost less [political_capital] political capital.,,,,,,
...together we can manifest a world of incredible material abundance and luxury for everyone...,,,,,,
..my party will join your coalition...,,,,,,
"Normally at this point you could hit that big ""Ready"" button to start running your plan.",,,,,,
"Press the ""Govt"" tab to head on over.",,,,,,
But first let's visit parliament and get you acquainted with the people there.,,,,,,
"Well, this is some exciting news.",,,,,,
"(I'm sure I could have solved it, if I weren't so busy here...)",,,,,,
The long elusive proof of existence and smoothness of solutions to the infamous Navier-Stokes equation has been discovered.,,,,,,
This will no doubt have a substantial impact all fields of research and engineering.,,,,,,
Umm... planner?,,,,,,
People are furious that our plans have privileged the wealthy countries.,,,,,,
Harassment of Gosplant planners and vandalism of infrastructure is becoming commonplace.,,,,,,
Our offices in the Global South have all started to notice the same thing:,,,,,,
It might get worse unless we assuage some of their concerns!,,,,,,
Deforestation of the Amazon has caused a gradual collapse of its self-feeding precipitation cycles. The rainforest is slowly turning to savanna.,,,,,,
Riots have escalated into full-blown revolt in some regions.,,,,,,
You need to take action to assuage their concerns and recover support for your plans.,,,,,,
The people are upset with how things have gone the last several years.,,,,,,
Otherwise this will end badly.,,,,,,
We have all the technologies in place to send out ships to settle new planets.,,,,,,
"We can't save Earth, at least not for everyone.",,,,,,
I urge you to focus establishing extraterrestrial human colonies...,,,,,,
...so that at least some of our species will survive.,,,,,,
Your death was celebrated by people around the world.,,,,,,
If only you could have done more...,,,,,,
...and people suffered for it.,,,,,,
Your administration had failed to achieve its goals in time...,,,,,,
"""Finally, an end to more than half a century of incompetence and disaster,"" they cheered.",,,,,,
Planner! How can you force these kinds of dietary restrictions on us?,,,,,,
You must reconsider this oppressive mandate!,,,,,,
Humans are *omnivores*--we need to eat meat!,,,,,,
And none of those silly substitutes can ever replicate the real thing.,,,,,,
Our dolphin friends have so much to teach us.,,,,,,
"For example, their method of water-birthing unlocks the secret of how humans can be birthed in space.",,,,,,
The Posadist is now an [ally] ally. Nuclear projects are substantially cheaper.,,,,,,
"This is obvious now, but it's getting quite a bit warmer.",,,,,,
"The ""nightshift"" has been said to increase health risks as well as potentially shorten lifespan!",,,,,,
"As we rely more heavily on air conditioners and fans, electricity usage will get higher.",,,,,,
Heatwaves are getting more frequent and intense.,,,,,,
Just something to be aware of.,,,,,,
"Energy companies have been preemptively shutting down power to avoid the possibility of sparking fires in the dry, windy conditions.  Pre-emptive blackouts could become a common occurrence.",,,,,,
"The increased demand for electricity, especially during peak periods, over-taxes the electrical grid, triggering brownouts and blackouts",,,,,,
We are seeing an overload of hospitalizations for people with outdoor professions...,,,,,,
"construction workers, miners, firefighters, agricultural workers, and the like.",,,,,,
Your legacy as a planner was one that you feared most:,,,,,,
If only you could go back and try again...,,,,,,
It didn't matter to them.,,,,,,
"Desperate and disheartened, people across the globe rose up against you and your plans.",,,,,,
Were you incompetent? Malicious?,,,,,,
...leaving the world in a worse shape than you found it.,,,,,,
It's either too little or too much water! Seems we can't get a good middle ground.,,,,,,
"More droughts and floods, more crop failures...we can't seem to catch a break!",,,,,,
You're an unrepentant murderer!,,,,,,
You throw away non-human life like it's nothing.,,,,,,
I will do whatever I can to stop you and defend the animal life you value so little.,,,,,,
The Animal Liberationist is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
You've exhausted all your political capital...,,,,,,
...so don't mess things up!,,,,,,
I believe in your decisions.,,,,,,
Hold on!,,,,,,
But they can only help you this one time...,,,,,,
Wow.,,,,,,
If they're vouching for you then you'll have a bit more political capital to work with.,,,,,,
I'll vouch for you. My word matters a lot to this generation. (+50[political_capital]),,,,,,
That was an important hero from the revolution.,,,,,,
Your enemies will see this as an opportunity to push you out of government.,,,,,,
"You know Edvard Munch's painting 'The Scream'? Well, its surreal sunset was caused by the eruption of Krakatau in 1883.",,,,,,
"So, we'll have white skies during the day and blood red sunsets. Some might like it but most will probably find the new sky disturbing.",,,,,,
More and more people are overwhelmed by dread. They fear a future of climatic disasters and mass extinction.,,,,,,
"This is causing serious mental health disorders, especially in the younger generations.",,,,,,
You have to cool the planet and stop the Sixth Extinction so people can have hope.,,,,,,
The overuse of anti-biotics in animal husbandry has caused this problem.,,,,,,
We estimate ten million people will die a year from what used to be preventable infections.,,,,,,
"It takes years of research to make new antibiotics, but now resistant strains emerge within a year.",,,,,,
I can't believe we finally did it! Half the Earth is now protected in nature preserves.,,,,,,
"There still are environmental problems, but perhaps the worst may be behind us...",,,,,,
This is the realization of the dream held by E. O. Wilson and many other conservationists decades ago.,,,,,,
"I see that patriarchy didn't die with the revolution, but rather transformed.",,,,,,
The same dynamics and attitudes that got us into these crises have found a way to persist in you and your disastrous plans.,,,,,,
It's time we stamp them out for good.,,,,,,
The Ecofeminist is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
These monoculture crop systems...,,,,,,
we ought to consider a move away from industrial agriculture.,,,,,,
"It saves me some effort, but it's just not worth betting our food supply on it.",,,,,,
Your reckless disregard for life is going to ruin us all!,,,,,,
We have such a unique opportunity to actually make things better for everyone.,,,,,,
Just to keep the party going a little longer for some?,,,,,,
The Utopian is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
But you're squandering it...for what?,,,,,,
I can't stand by while you do that.,,,,,,
My home is becoming too inhospitable...,,,,,,
"...disaster after disaster, always worrying about what will happen next.",,,,,,
"I don't want to go, but I have to. Somewhere that's safer for me and my family.",,,,,,
I know of so many others who are in a similar situation...,,,,,,
I hope one day I can go back.,,,,,,
"What a tragedy. A hundred thousand people perished last week, most of them elderly. ",,,,,,
"We have to cool things down and fast, otherwise more people will die. These disasters make people lose hope that things will get better.",,,,,,
Some say that in 20 years we will see a significant shift in political ideology as the previous generations perish under the impact of climate change.,,,,,,
I feel like we have a similar vision for the world.,,,,,,
My party will commit its seats to our shared vision and join your coalition.,,,,,,
"""Go back again, now you have seen us, and your outward eyes have learned that in spite of all the infallible maxims of your day there is yet a time of rest in store for the world, when mastery has changed into fellowship.""",,,,,,
"Before I go, let me leave you a favorite quote from William Morris:",,,,,,
I look forward to working together.,,,,,,
"The Utopian is now an [ally] ally. Limits, Protection, and Restoration projects are cheaper.",,,,,,
"Clathrates frozen for eons in cenozic bogs are thawing, releasing billions of tons of methane all at once.",,,,,,
...but this is still a huge disaster,,,,,,
Microbes are digesting much of the methane and emitting less-intense carbon dioxide instead,,,,,,
"We've been engaged in a lot of big projects recently, which is good but bottlenecks are inevitable.",,,,,,
I suggest either running fewer competing projects or we could start deep-sea mining.,,,,,,
What have we done?,,,,,,
"Planner! You're bias towards ""technology"" and ""industry"" is putting the world--and yourself--on a dangerous path.",,,,,,
"The Earth is calling for our aid and so we, the Earth Liberation Front, have returned.",,,,,,
You better abandon that cozy relationship with the Accelerationist or else we'll have to take drastic action to protect the planet.,,,,,,
Your plans have shown nothing but contempt for the people of the Global South.,,,,,,
The Fanonist is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
I won't let that happen again.,,,,,,
I should have known that the promises of the revolution were just more lies to get us to play along.,,,,,,
"Once again, we are just fuel to burn on the altar of progress.",,,,,,
These 'land hurricanes' are becoming a more common occurrence.,,,,,,
"If you can get the temperature anomaly under control, we should see fewer of these.",,,,,,
They're basically massive high-intensity wind storms that can devastate an area.,,,,,,
Easily accessible methane will run out in twenty years at current usage.,,,,,,
I suggest you find another source of energy posthaste.,,,,,,
Some regions are really unhappy with your decisions. Protests cropping up everywhere.,,,,,,
Your plans have only brought us only hardship!,,,,,,
I thought you were,,,,,,
We've been struck by a nasty case of wheat rust that's putting many in a shaky place with regards to food.,,,,,,
"I know it's our policy to make sure everyone's fed, so we're working on organizing food aid to the affected areas.",,,,,,
...and try this one instead...,,,,,,
"You know, I think we should reconsider that policy...",,,,,,
It seems like that permafrost melting has released some ancient organism into the world.,,,,,,
I think we should let it run its course...,,,,,,
"If we developed phage therapy, perhaps we can keep it under control.",,,,,,
Highly contagious? How interesting... It's almost as if nature itself is finally doing something about overpopulation.,,,,,,
"Yes, it's a highly contagious and dangerous bacteria. We're keeping an eye on it.",,,,,,
Your plans have been a waste of our time and energy!,,,,,,
Things aren't getting better. We won't waste any more effort on ineffective action.,,,,,,
Dead zones at our lakes and river deltas have become worse than we imagined.,,,,,,
Much of the Gulf of Mexico has depleted oxygen levels.,,,,,,
This level of agricultural fertilizer use and untreated sewage cannot be sustained.,,,,,,
People are abandoning the old religions and are turning instead to Gaia...,,,,,,
"With no other recourse, people around the world rose up in fury against you and your tyrannical plans.",,,,,,
If only you could go back and try again...,,,,,,
Did you believe this was the only way to preserve planetary civilization?,,,,,,
In your last breaths you reflected on your legacy...,,,,,,
It didn't matter to them.,,,,,,
Wide-ranging changes are needed to put us on a long-term path towards sustainability.,,,,,,
Just swipe a card into the scanner and presto! It's added to your plan.,,,,,,
"If you change your mind, you can swipe it down to remove it from the plan.",,,,,,
It takes regional governments one planning cycle to implement policies.,,,,,,
Here you can use your [political_capital] political capital to wrangle support for policies to implement worldwide.,,,,,,
And that's all there is to it!,,,,,,
"Feel free to continue to explore, but whenever you're ready press the big ""Ready"" button to launch your plan.",,,,,,
All our solar processes are seeing dips in output.,,,,,,
Probably because of the grey skies?,,,,,,
"I know the solar radiation management project keeps things cool, but we need energy too.",,,,,,
"As you pushed through change after change, your political enemies conspired against you.",,,,,,
If only you could go back and try again...,,,,,,
It didn't matter to them.,,,,,,
They took the opportunity to oust you from power once you'd exhausted all the political capital you had in parliament.,,,,,,
Was the world getting better?,,,,,,
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is a vital ocean current.,,,,,,
We didn't expect this to happen this century...,,,,,,
Remember that 1970s novel Ecotopia? I feel like we've actually realized that dream.,,,,,,
"You can't ignore whats been happening in Ecotopia. While the rest of the world crumbles in consumerism and nonstop progress, Ecotopia is a small window into what could be.",,,,,,
Welcome to the Gosplant planning application. You can call me Gossy.,,,,,,
Got it?,,,,,,
Good luck!,,,,,,
And if the people are [nemesis] unhappy with your performance you will be removed from your position.,,,,,,
"If you get stuck, you can tap on most things for more details and reminders.",,,,,,
You'll need to spend [political_capital] political capital if you want something to happen.,,,,,,
It's your job to guide us all safely through the next century.,,,,,,
But you don't have complete authority to make decisions unilaterally.,,,,,,
You'll need to spend [political_capital] political capital if you want something to happen.,,,,,,
Got it?,,,,,,
"But if you run out of political capital, you will be recalled and your term will end.",,,,,,
"If you get stuck, you can tap on most things for more details and reminders.",,,,,,
"...Anyways, just click the ""Add"" button there to start making your plan.",,,,,,
"...Anyways, just click the ""Add"" button there to start making your plan.",,,,,,
Got it?,,,,,,
This planning application lets you make your plan.,,,,,,
"You can set [research] research priorities, initiate large-scale [initiative] projects, implement [policy] policies, or ban certain production processes.",,,,,,
Good luck!,,,,,,
Good luck!,,,,,,
"You can set [research] research priorities, initiate large-scale [initiative] projects, implement [policy] policies, or ban certain production processes.",,,,,,
"Following the recent revolution, you've been elected as the lead planner.",,,,,,
This planning application lets you make your plan.,,,,,,
And if the people are [nemesis] unhappy with your performance you will be removed from your position.,,,,,,
We're seeing elevated rates of respiratory disease in populations across the world.,,,,,,
Surely it must be from the particles used for the solar radiation management program. They've started settling back towards ground level and entering people's lungs.,,,,,,
That's the only thing in common across the global population that I can think of.,,,,,,
I'm getting older and I remember how the change came in the early 2020s...,,,,,,
"Things were hard at first, but now I think we're close to really creating a utopian society.",,,,,,
"The question is, is this end of history or its start?",,,,,,
We don't have to work hard anymore and the environmental crisis is subsiding.,,,,,,
I'm glad that it didn't turn out to be that way.,,,,,,
My island is almost completely underwater...,,,,,,
It's only a matter of time before so many others will have to grapple with the same realization.,,,,,,
Why did we have to abandon the land of our ancestors because of crimes to the Earth we did not commit?,,,,,,
How could you let it get this bad?,,,,,,
Now I'm coming to terms with the fact that we'll never be able to go back.,,,,,,
"We evacuated some time ago, hoping that we could find some way to return home.",,,,,,
The harvest of the humble—but very important—potato has taken a big hit this year.,,,,,,
"It is an important basic food for millions, and we risk a famine this year.",,,,,,
Never really liked it much myself.,,,,,,
Moving away from industrial agriculture will lower the chances these events.,,,,,,
"More work for me, but hey, if it reliably keeps us fed, I guess that's alright.",,,,,,
We're really struggling to produce enough food to feed everyone.,,,,,,
"Whether it's too hot, or there's too much water, or not enough, or whatever else is going on...",,,,,,
...you've got to do something about it!,,,,,,
*COUGH* The constant smoke from wildfires is interfering with farming...plants need sunlight!,,,,,,
...solar infrastructure too. *COUGH*,,,,,,
We're also seeing higher rates of respiratory disease. *COUGH*,,,,,,
This is your planning dashboard. It summarizes the state of the world today.,,,,,,
Use this information to figure out the biggest contributors to problem areas.,,,,,,
"When you're ready, let's head over to the ""World"" tab.",,,,,,
Tapping some values will show a detailed breakdown. Or you can use the chart below.,,,,,,
I'm seeing a disturbing increase in incidences of skin cancers and diseases.,,,,,,
I'm sure that it's because of the ozone depletion we're experiencing.,,,,,,
I encourage you to stop the solar radiation management project to stop it from progressing any further!,,,,,,
Extreme wildfires are now a regular occurrence.,,,,,,
"...making some people permanently without a home, forever on the move as they are chased by flames.",,,,,,
These fires can consume swaths of land in what feels like a blink of an eye...,,,,,,
In 2022 a socialist revolution swept the globe.,,,,,,
"It's a sunny day in Havana, where the first planning session will take place...",,,,,,
You have been elected as [gosplant]'s first lead planner.,,,,,,
"And you must do so without letting your [political_capital]<em class=""lose-con"">political capital dip below 0</em>...",,,,,,
"You must do so without letting people's [contentedness]<em class=""lose-con"">contentedness dip below 0</em>...",,,,,,
"The regions of the world united to establish [gosplant], a global planning authority.",,,,,,
[gosplant] was tasked with undoing the myriad harms that centuries of capitalism had unleashed on the planet and its people.,,,,,,
Otherwise your adversaries may take the opportunity to replace you.,,,,,,
Otherwise they will vote you out of office.,,,,,,
"It's your duty to bring [warming]<em class=""win-con"">warming to below 1°C</em>, the [extinction_rate]<em class=""win-con"">extinction rate to below 20</em>, and [emissions]<em class=""win-con"">emissions to below 0</em> while there's still time.",,,,,,
One of my colleagues was murdered last night!,,,,,,
...but what else can we do?,,,,,,
...And I've received numerous death threats too.,,,,,,
People are tremendously upset about our solar radiation management program...,,,,,,
We have been observing your planet for some time now...,,,,,,
We are encouraged by your efforts...,,,,,,
"they may not be enough, but any effort to right past wrongs should be nurtured.",,,,,,
Good luck.,,,,,,
...and watched your struggles to right the wrongs of your species' past.,,,,,,
...so please accept this gift from us.,,,,,,
In our travels we have not encountered any advanced life that is without a history of atrocity and ignorance.,,,,,,
It will help dissipate the warming shroud that envelops your beautiful planet.,,,,,,
Yet few reckon with their past...,,,,,,
...or last long enough to try.,,,,,,
...you're really misguided...,,,,,,
...i'll do whatever i can to stop you.,,,,,,
...taking us away from limitless prosperity for everyone...,,,,,,
The Accelerationist is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
Our high quality lithium reserves are being depleted more rapidly than we thought.,,,,,,
"Lithium's not only important for battery technology, but we use it to breed tritium for our fusion reactors.",,,,,,
"There's really not much tritium on earth, but there is quite a bit on the moon...",,,,,,
Did you know that maitake farmers are a vital part of local food chains?,,,,,,
"The Ecofeminist is now an [ally] ally. Food, Agriculture, and Protection projects are cheaper.",,,,,,
The greatest pleasures are only narrowly separated from disgust.,,,,,,
We welcome you.,,,,,,
You seem like someone who understands this...so my party is willing to join your coalition.,,,,,,
We welcome you.,,,,,,
It's almost as if a whole economy has come out of the burnt ruins in which the mushrooms grow.,,,,,,
The greatest pleasures are only narrowly separated from disgust.,,,,,,
"The Ecofeminist is now an [ally] ally. Food, Agriculture, and Protection projects are cheaper.",,,,,,
Would you be interested in foraging for mushrooms?,,,,,,
I was talking to a friend in the city and they were describing to me how trendy it is to have a small urban garden.,,,,,,
Plus people are getting a kick out of eating food they've had a hand in growing themselves.,,,,,,
Less work for me!,,,,,,
"Most of these gardens are modest, but they're able to grow quite a bit of food for the community!",,,,,,
Amateur plant breeding has become a bit of trend lately!,,,,,,
Citizens are trying to come up with their own crosses with better tolerances for more extreme climates.,,,,,,
There have been a few notable successes! We're sharing these seeds with farmers around the world.,,,,,,
It's as if our soil has up and left.,,,,,,
This poses a serious respiratory health risk. We need to enact masking ordinances.,,,,,,
The end is near.,,,,,,
This is bad. A collapse this large and the displacement of that much water will surely have other effects.,,,,,,
"It finally happened. I hope I'd never have to say these words, but here we are.",,,,,,
"I know of some are looking for a way to restore reefs, but I don't know how likely it is to work.",,,,,,
The Great Barrier Reef is dead. And other reefs are suffering a similar fate.,,,,,,
It should have never happened in the first place.,,,,,,
Either solar radiation management or coal power plants have caused acid rain to return...,,,,,,
"...but you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, right?",,,,,,
" What's worse, we will risk major accidents if this continues.",,,,,,
"The bridges and buildings are crumbling, you need to put more money into public infrastructure.",,,,,,
I don't think it's worth it.,,,,,,
"The sulphuric acid eats away at concrete, turning the calcium carbonate into gypsum. We'll have to rebuild many of our bridges and buildings decades years earlier than we expected.  People aren't happy about their cities seemingly melting away in front of their eyes.",,,,,,
"The acid eats away at concrete, causes 'forest death', and kills lakes. ",,,,,,
"Actually, it's not that significant.",,,,,,
People's are not happy with your performance...[hud_contentedness] outlook is really low.,,,,,,
You need to get a handle on this situation or your career as a planner will come to an end one way or another.,,,,,,
This is a message from the people!,,,,,,
BOOM,,,,,,
You ought to--,,,,,,
That was a close one--that grenade nearly got you!,,,,,,
We've got to do something about the rising temperature!,,,,,,
"I recommend throwing all our options we have at the issue, one of them has got to work!",,,,,,
A train filled with Nyodene Derivative has derailed near your location.,,,,,,
"It's hard to hear the radio reports of the disaster over the white noise of your equipment, TV, tablet, and smartphone.",,,,,,
"But you can't leave, you're an important planning professional! ",,,,,,
"This September, our satellites recorded...",,,,,,
The change from high albedo ice to a dark sea will accelerate warming.,,,,,,
Zero square kilometres of arctic sea ice.,,,,,,
"Planner, you don't look so good...",,,,,,
THUD,,,,,,
Planner?,,,,,,
Maybe you should lie down for a bit.,,,,,,
"A new virus has emerged, either from a factory farm or a degraded forest, we don't know yet for sure.",,,,,,
"As long as we have a large livestock industry and deforestation, these tragedies will keep happening.",,,,,,
"The mortality rate is 2%, which can still kill millions but we predict that a new zoonosis could much deadlier.",,,,,,
"This one was bad, but ",,,,,,
"As Trotsky once said: 'Man will occupy himself with re-registering mountains and rivers, and will earnestly and repeatedly make improvements in nature.'",,,,,,
"You are so, so misguided.",,,,,,
I'm not going to let you ruin everything.,,,,,,
"Sure, we'll be equal, but only in common misery.",,,,,,
You really think we can all live on this Earth without torpedoing living standards?,,,,,,
The Malthusian is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
The natural world just cannot support this many people.,,,,,,
"By removing so many dams, rivers around the world have come back to life. ",,,,,,
"Cases of schistomiasis, caused by parasitic worms, have also fallen dramatically! ",,,,,,
"Rewilding and river restoration has not only decreased methane emissions and regulated streamflows, but also decreased wildfire severity. Thank a beaver.",,,,,,
The rapid rate of permafrost melting is releasing new methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.,,,,,,
It's one more source of emissions that we'll need to worry about.,,,,,,
Protests against your plans have escalated into riots in some places.,,,,,,
See if you can turn things around...I don't like where this is going.,,,,,,
We'll need help from various technologies and techniques to survive and flourish over the next century.,,,,,,
Plan items are represented as these cards here.,,,,,,
"Drag a card up into the scanner to add it to your plan, and hold it there to commit more [research] research points.",,,,,,
"If you change your mind, drag the card down to reset its points.",,,,,,
Here you can turn [political_capital] political capital into [research] research points and use that to set research priorities.,,,,,,
"Not only new ones, but also the re-introduction and refinement of older ones too.",,,,,,
This is extremely dangerous as now the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet is at risk.,,,,,,
I packed up and left the city some time ago when the reruralization program started.,,,,,,
"I love it. Hikes through the forests, volunteering on local farms, having time to swim and read...",,,,,,
I know many others share my experience.,,,,,,
"With the new train network, it's not too difficult for me to visit the city when I'm craving it.",,,,,,
"I'd never seen myself living out in the country, but I was in a tough time and thought a fresh start might do me good.",,,,,,
We're seeing signs of ozone depletion at a worrying rate.,,,,,,
I suspect this may have to do with solar radiation management...,,,,,,
You get it! I can see it!,,,,,,
"There are too many! A lot of people are scared of that reality, but I can see that you aren't.",,,,,,
The Malthusian is now an [ally] ally. Population projects are substantially cheaper.,,,,,,
My party will join your coalition.,,,,,,
We need more planners like you to do what needs to be done.,,,,,,
"We can chase all the new technologies we want, or try to live in peace with nature...",,,,,,
"but nothing changes the fact that it all comes down to people, people, people!",,,,,,
"This happened once before in Europe during the 14th century, no one knows for sure why it started.",,,,,,
Perhaps the compulsive dancing allows some relief from stress and grinding poverty.,,,,,,
"Maybe it's a dance craze, but my professional opinion is that people are too anxious. We've got to do something to make people's lives easier",,,,,,
I feel like you're missing the bigger picture.,,,,,,
"You've kind of got tunnel vision with this whole earth stuff, don't you think?",,,,,,
The only way we can truly achieve communism is through first contact.,,,,,,
We need to reach out to other lifeforms and see what they can teach us.,,,,,,
The Posadist is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
"Well, it happened again. This new disease also appears zoonotic in origin.",,,,,,
High land use or livestock production increase the risk of this problem...,,,,,,
...maybe you can take a look at those?,,,,,,
There are too many people in this world anyway.,,,,,,
"Once-in-a-decade heavy rains have now become commonplace, leading to overflowing rivers capable of destroying hundreds of homes.",,,,,,
"If you can do anything to lower the temperature, we should see fewer of these events.",,,,,,
Some crops are doing well with the heat and extra CO2 in the air...,,,,,,
..but overall yields are down and they'll just get worse the warmer it gets!,,,,,,
...but they also make things worse in the long-run.,,,,,,
Industrialized agriculture and vertical farming are the most resilient against these temperatures...,,,,,,
You need to cool things off--fast--or we'll be seeing a lot of hungry people.,,,,,,
You seem like someone who loves nature.,,,,,,
It's all about ~harmony~.,,,,,,
"Anyway, my party is joining your coalition, since I think we feel the same way.",,,,,,
You also seem like someone who still recognizes that we're not trying to drive ourselves to extinction just to save it.,,,,,,
The Environmentalist is now an [ally] ally. Restoration projects are substantially cheaper.,,,,,,
We gotta find a way to live ~harmoniously~ with nature.,,,,,,
Uh oh--it looks like there are some production shortages.,,,,,,
You may need to change your production mixes to compensate for resource limitations.,,,,,,
You can tap the pulsing [alert] alert icon for more information.,,,,,,
"The Wollemi pines have existed for 200 millions years, but the last natural forest was recently destroyed in a wildfire.",,,,,,
We gave you a nice warning about banning meat and you've ignored us.,,,,,,
Maybe you'll listen now?,,,,,,
"I'm sorry, planner, but your access rights to the Gosplant planning interface have been revoked.",,,,,,
They are replacing you with someone else.,,,,,,
You've run out of [political_capital] political capital...and lost the backing of members of parliament.,,,,,,
The benefits of rewilding reduces the likelihood of more zoonotic disease.,,,,,,
Clearing of otherwise undisturbed land to make room for things like industrial farming opens up opportunities for the transmission of pathogens from animals to humans.,,,,,,
"Well, the emergence of zoonotic diseases is closely related to ecological disturbance. ",,,,,,
"Wow, uranium stocks have been run down fast by the massive increase in reactors worldwide. At this rate, we'll run out of high-quality uranium ore in twenty years.",,,,,,
"If you want to keep the lights on, you better find alternative energy sources. If you want to stick with nuclear, we better do a crash course in researching fusion, fast-breeders, or thorium reactors.",,,,,,
This didn't really do much.,,,,,,
"In 1816, a volcanic eruption cooled the global climate and caused widespread famine. The ""year without a summer"" inspired Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. ",,,,,,
So exciting!,,,,,,
Maybe we'll get another great novel out of this...,,,,,,
Regulation and permits did nothing to control tailings waste from making its way into the water supply.,,,,,,
This is a betrayal of our primate family; a wound that can never be healed.,,,,,,
You need to do more to protect the natural world.,,,,,,
The Environmentalist is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
I don't like getting angry but you're really pushing it.,,,,,,
I've gotta put my foot down.,,,,,,
"Wow, two dozen countries suffered from record heat-waves, some topping 50°C for weeks.",,,,,,
We need a better solution.,,,,,,
It isn't safe for people to work in these temperatures.,,,,,,
"There are ways to cool down, but they can only help so much.",,,,,,
Pesticides from industrial agriculture have spread through the ecosystem with devastating consequences.,,,,,,
"It was as Rachel Carson foretold: 'on the mornings that had once throbbed with the dawn chorus of robins, catbirds, doves, jays, wrens, and scores of other bird voices there was now no sound; only silence lay over the fields and woods and marsh.' ",,,,,,
"As Donna Haraway once said, 'Tentacularity is about life lived along lines ...  not at points, not in spheres.' ",,,,,,
"We are all compost, not posthuman.",,,,,,
A tsunami from the recent ice sheet collapse has caused incredible devastation.,,,,,,
Some scientists hypothesized that melting ice sheets could trigger an earthquake as the Earth's crust rises.,,,,,,
If only this could have been avoided...,,,,,,
This outbreak is much much worse than anything we've seen before...,,,,,,
We need to do something about that.,,,,,,
The mortality rate could be as high as 50%. We have estimates of one billion deaths coming in.,,,,,,
"As long as we have animal husbandry and a biodiversity crisis, these epidemics can keep on happening.",,,,,,
We have a wide array of processes to produce two critical resources: [food] food and [energy] energy.,,,,,,
Why don't you try changing some process mixes now?,,,,,,
Different processes have different benefits and drawbacks.,,,,,,
"And some require certain feedstocks, like [oil] oil or [uranium] uranium, that could become degraded. So keep an eye on those.",,,,,,
"If you need any more information about a process, just tap on it to flip it.",,,,,,
"Some may require much more [land] land or more [energy] energy, for example.",,,,,,
"Of course, it will take time to make all of these changes.",,,,,,
Here you can change the [mix_token] production mix for each of these resources.,,,,,,
Wildfires are growing in frequency and severity.,,,,,,
For now we'll track these events on the globe.,,,,,,
So don't be surprised if people,,,,,,
We have to lower temperatures quickly and introduce natural solutions to manage this problem.,,,,,,
"There are several communities that live in high fire zones, when their homes are burn down they are displaced for long periods of time, some are never able to secure stable housing afterwards..",,,,,,
That's right. You can look through some options at the next planning session.,,,,,,
"Whole towns are suffering from PTSD, this is a mental health crisis!",,,,,,
"Wildfires, of course, make it harder for people to live in an area.",,,,,,
"Most of the people effected are elderly and not tech savy, they are suspicious of ""apps"" and think they are talking to a robot.",,,,,,
We're having a really hard time keeping the power flowing...,,,,,,
You ought to figure out some way to bring more stability--maybe changing where we get our power from?,,,,,,
...there's just not enough reliable power to go around.,,,,,,
"Or reducing energy consumption? Or increasing the battery network? Whatever it is, do it fast!",,,,,,
The mass electrification initiative is stretching existing copper production to its limit.,,,,,,
Even with recycling there just isn't enough to meet our needs.,,,,,,
We've developed new mines and expanded existing ones wherever residents consented.,,,,,,
But that hasn't been enough. What should we do?,,,,,,
"The extinction rate is high, the world is warming...",,,,,,
"Such as the delicious matsutake mushroom, which only grows in disturbed forests.",,,,,,
We must learn to appreciate the unexpected boons...,,,,,,
"Yet, ecofeminist scholarship teaches us to reconcile ourselves to living in a world of ruins.",,,,,,
What a waste of life! What a tragedy!,,,,,,
"A tragedy, sure, but also an opportunity...",,,,,,
Your plans will benefit from having others on board.,,,,,,
...that's right...,,,,,,
"Not if we let human nature run its course! This is a time of urgency, and we have to act swiftly.",,,,,,
"Yes, exactly!",,,,,,
nothing so drastic is necessary...we finally can unleash technology from the yoke of capitalism...,,,,,,
Some projects will require a majority coalition in parliament to implement.,,,,,,
Hm.,,,,,,
"Well, whatever you do, keep in mind that these people will come to love or hate you for it.",,,,,,
Tap on a party to learn more.,,,,,,
That means taking the hard route that others might frown upon. Don't you agree?,,,,,,
We have a unique opportunity to reshape our relationship with nature and each other.,,,,,,
Hm.,,,,,,
"Well, whatever you do, keep in mind that these people will come to love or hate you for it.",,,,,,
"Well, whatever you do, keep in mind that these people will come to love or hate you for it.",,,,,,
Hello planner! What an exciting time.,,,,,,
Some parties have special abilities that can help as well.,,,,,,
"Other parties (shown here) may join your coalition as [ally] allies, depending on what you add to your plan.",,,,,,
Hm.,,,,,,
"Anyways, let's head over to the ""Stats"" tab now.",,,,,,
"Well, whatever you do, keep in mind that these people will come to love or hate you for it.",,,,,,
"Anyways, let's head over to the ""Stats"" tab now.",,,,,,
"Anyways, let's head over to the ""Stats"" tab now.",,,,,,
I'm glad we see eye-to-eye.,,,,,,
...creating such abundance that our worst instincts become irrelevant...,,,,,,
It looks like an increasing number of places are running out of clean water. Things are getting ugly.,,,,,,
Do what you can to both increase supply of fresh water and to lower demands on it.,,,,,,
"I didn't think it was possible, but it seems we will run out of viable coal reserves in twenty years if we keep it up.",,,,,,
I suggest you build up a new energy system quickly.,,,,,,
Ocean acidification and over-fishing have led to declines in marine population that may be hard to recover from.,,,,,,
"But if your concern is feeding people, I suppose ",,,,,,
This will no doubt have reverberations throughout various food webs.,,,,,,
"I never truly believed it was possible, but we have achieved real equality for all of humanity!",,,,,,
Our homes are so inhospitable...,,,,,,
we are desperate to find safety for our families.,,,,,,
"No one can leave, try as we might!",,,,,,
How can you allow this to happen?,,,,,,
These damn borders have turned out region into a death sentence!,,,,,,
They've eaten everything... blotted out the sun.,,,,,,
I've never witnessed anything like it. It's as if hell had risen to Earth.,,,,,,
"Welcome--You seem to know your way around here, so I'll just get out of your way!",,,,,,
Attention: We have commandeered an anti-aircraft battery.,,,,,,
Oh no.,,,,,,
We tried reasoning with you but you ignored us--this is the only thing we can do.,,,,,,
It's a matter of our survival.,,,,,,
We will immediately begin shooting down the solar radiation management fleet that have disrupted our region's monsoons.,,,,,,
The temperature effects from the solar radiation management project will be undone almost immediately...,,,,,,
People are not happy with your performance...[hud_contentedness] outlook is really low.,,,,,,
A mob has raided our building! They're looking for you.,,,,,,
Any last words?,,,,,,
We are tired of living under your tyrannical plans--they've brought us nothing but misery!,,,,,,
"As Garrett Hardin so eloquently once said, ""The freedom to breed is intolerable.""",,,,,,
"Now that you've added some projects to your plan, let's try changing our production processes.",,,,,,
"Press ""Change Production"" to go to the process manager.",,,,,,
But first let's visit parliament and get you acquainted with the people there.,,,,,,
"Press the ""Govt"" tab to head on over.",,,,,,
One of the worst case scenarios has just happened...,,,,,,
"...you can't sweat, so your body can't cool itself off, and so you just basically...slowly cook in the heat.",,,,,,
What a horrible way to go. And to imagine that millions died in that way.,,,,,,
"a ""wet-bulb"" event, where temperature and humidity combine to be intolerable...",,,,,,
Surely we could have prevented this?,,,,,,
You rich Northerners will not sacrifice half the world on your altar of greed.,,,,,,
"Ha, if you think there are too many people then let us help you get rid of the Malthusians!",,,,,,
Planner! Either you are with us or with the Wretched. Make your choice.,,,,,,
"People really like living in McMansions, I guess. ",,,,,,
...but also spillover into exurbs as some seek to escape the growing density of cities.,,,,,,
They only care about their own consumption.,,,,,,
No one seems to care that we are living during an environmental crisis.,,,,,,
"Warmer waters are bad for most marine species. Many kinds of jellyfish, however, thrive in these conditions.",,,,,,
It doesn't help that too much fishing means there are fewer predators and competitors for jellyfish.,,,,,,
"Even if some people care little about the oceans, they'll be annoyed when their beach holiday is ruined. ",,,,,,
We've hit an interesting milestone--the 4000th nuclear reactor was just built.,,,,,,
"It makes me a little bit nervous, but at least it's not as dirty as fossil fuels, eh?",,,,,,
The planning session has concluded.,,,,,,
Now it's time to see what happens over the next several years.,,,,,,
Global meat consumption has gone up by almost 50% since we started.,,,,,,
"People may enjoy their cheeseburgers, but this comes at a huge cost to the environment, animals, and human health.",,,,,,
People around the world mourned your death.,,,,,,
...an uncomfortable uncertainty about the future shrouded the planet.,,,,,,
While many ambitious and talented planners would take your place...,,,,,,
There was still so much work to be done.,,,,,,
If only you could have done more...,,,,,,
"In spite of all that happened, people saw their lives change for the better.",,,,,,
"I can't believe it, but looking at all the numbers...",,,,,,
...and have a stronger foundation to continue improving.,,,,,,
We've done it.,,,,,,
We've undone so much of centuries of damage on people and the planet...,,,,,,
This is probably the first time in centuries that we can confidently say we're leaving a better planet for future generations.,,,,,,
The eruption has created an atmospheric shroud that has cooled the world by a degree.,,,,,,
"It will only last a few years, then things will warm up again, but imagine if we created our own atmospheric shroud with solar radiation management?",,,,,,
We have been observing your planet for some time now...,,,,,,
...and watched your relentless war against all other life.,,,,,,
...even if that means wiping out your pathetic species!,,,,,,
We are obligated to defend life in all its forms!,,,,,,
Hey! You were zoning out there for a second.,,,,,,
You don't look so well.,,,,,,
Perhaps you should consider retirement?,,,,,,
Are you ok?,,,,,,
The stress of planning may be too much for your age.,,,,,,
"::BOOM:: There goes my trusty hail cannon, ::BOOM:: working it's magic.",,,,,,
"For the last 20 years since I installed the hail cannon, I haven't seen any hail coming to destroy my crops.",,,,,,
"There hasn't been hail in the area for the last 20 years in general though, not just surrounding your farm...",,,,,,
Hail cannons are really unlikely to disturb the formation of hailstones in the atmosphere.,,,,,,
So amazing that farmers came up with this novel geoengineering idea.,,,,,,
"These heat waves have extended all the way to the boreal forest, That's very dangerous.",,,,,,
"Because the boreal forest is not managed as intensely as other forests, the trees have been able to grow undisturbed, amassing large amounts of carbon in their roots and trunks. Twenty percent of the carbon held in forests in the world is in the boreal forest. ",,,,,,
"Because the boreal forest is not managed as intensely as other forests, the trees have been able to grow undisturbed, amassing large amounts of carbon in their roots and trunks. Twenty percent of the carbon held in forests in the world is in the boreal forest. ",,,,,,
"Frequent fire also threatens the permafrost—it can also lead to burning belowground, which melts the permafrost and can emit large amounts of carbon in a short time.",,,,,,
"The boreal forest is shifting from a carbon sink to a carbon source, meaning it emits more carbon than it stores.",,,,,,
"But most of the carbon is found in the permafrost, an underground layer of ice, rock, sand, and soil that is below freezing. The permafrost layer represents the largest carbon sink in the world.",,,,,,
"A copper mining operation opened near my town, even after we voted against it!",,,,,,
"It's too close to us and our water supply, and people are getting stick from it!",,,,,,
I thought this kind of thing was behind us!,,,,,,
Surely there are better sites? How desperate are we for copper that we need to be put in harm's way for it?,,,,,,
We've come to the end of your first planning cycle.,,,,,,
Improvements will foster confidence in your planning and gain you [political_capital] political capital.,,,,,,
To manage your [political_capital] political capital you'll need to balance short-term improvements with your long-term plans.,,,,,,
"On the flip side, setbacks and worsening conditions will lose you [political_capital] political capital.",,,,,,
At the end of each cycle you'll be presented a report summarizing changes.,,,,,,
"The auroch went extinct in 1627, but it has proven possible to 'back-breed' cattle and recover lost traits such as longer legs and horns.",,,,,,
"We call the breed 'Tauros' because they are not true aurochs, but pretty close. ",,,,,,
They will fill an important ecological niche in rewilding programs.,,,,,,
Have you been to our Havana offices?,,,,,,
"We have supercomputers to make a series of global plans simulating snapshots of the future: say, five detailed blueprints of the planet five years out, ten for the coming decade, and a couple dozen for the next quarter century.",,,,,,
Oh it isn't just me. Thousands of people work there from all over the world.,,,,,,
"Havana has had the most experience with planning, decarbonization, and organic agriculture, so I guess it made sense to put the bureau there..",,,,,,
"Well, the parts of the world that have joined the Half-Earth Socialist bloc all provide data, technical expertise, and proposals to the central planning bureau in Cuba.",,,,,,
Heatwaves are so frequent and intense these days...,,,,,,
"It's made life more bearable, although of course not everyone can work at night.",,,,,,
I hope to,,,,,,
...most people can barely be outside during the day.,,,,,,
"people sleep during the day, and do everything else at night.",,,,,,
My town has shifted everything to a night schedule--,,,,,,
I hope to see a return to how things were one day. I miss the sun.,,,,,,
It's happening...major pollinator populations are collapsing.,,,,,,
This will just threaten broader ecosystems even more.,,,,,,
"We'll have to manually pollinate some crops, which means yields will decline...",,,,,,
Pollinators are important to ecosystems in addition to their role in agriculture.,,,,,,
I've noticed your vitals are dipping...,,,,,,
"...you're getting up there in age, don't forget to take some time to rest.",,,,,,
"With the move away from meat consumption, livestock operations are stuck with billions of animals and nothing to do with them.",,,,,,
What should we do with them?,,,,,,
We can't release them into the wild because that would wreak havoc on ecosystems.,,,,,,
My neighbors and I got rid of our lawns and encouraged native grasses to grow instead.,,,,,,
"Vole and shrew populations have rebounded, as have wildflowers like lupine (my favorite).",,,,,,
"I've grown to appreciate how much we can do for our local environment, even as we try to change the world.",,,,,,
"Beautiful. These changes have brought a wealth of wildlife into our cities, like voles, shrews, and lupine!",,,,,,
We rewilded the local golf course. I don't even miss the game as I got into birding instead.,,,,,,
My town has become contaminated by the old tailings leaking into the ground water. People are dying.,,,,,,
There needs to be a major global program to remediate abandoned mines.,,,,,,
"There used to be a lot of rare earth mining around here, but it's long been abandoned.",,,,,,
But those damn pigs never cleaned anything up! And now we're being poisoned because of it.,,,,,,
I feel like you truly have the interest of non-human life at heart.,,,,,,
The Animal Liberationist is now an [ally] ally. Food projects are much cheaper.,,,,,,
Not many feel the same way...,,,,,,
My party will join your coalition.,,,,,,
Non-humans will finally have a voice in government!,,,,,,
I appreciate how well we've worked together...,,,,,,
We know what's best for humanity and the natural world...,,,,,,
but the other parties just get in the way.,,,,,,
If we suspend parliament we could implement our plans without any obstruction.,,,,,,
I have a proposal to take our relationship to the next level.,,,,,,
"I have an idea, something we tried back in the 2010s against the anti-frackers...",,,,,,
Aren't your enemies so irritating? What can we do to restrict their reach?,,,,,,
The Authoritarian is now an [ally] ally. You won't lose if contentedness dips below 0.,,,,,,
"Planner--we told you to leave the earth-killing Accelerationist behind, but you wouldn't listen.",,,,,,
Now we're left with no other choice but to strike at the heart of your grotesque industry!,,,,,,
The tests are in!,,,,,,
"So many fewer respiratory illnesses and other complications, saving millions of lives a year.",,,,,,
People seem happier now. Keep up the good work!,,,,,,
"My skin feels so much better, and my daughter has barely needed her inhaler in recent years.",,,,,,
Declining fossil fuel combustion has meant a drastic drop in air pollution.,,,,,,
"So many fewer respiratory illnesses and other complications, saving millions of lives a year.",,,,,,
"What a disaster! All those people had to leave their homes and try to make a new life in the cooler, more stable parts of the world. ",,,,,,
Don't be a fool. It's their fault they didn't adapt or prove resilient in these hard times. I say we keep them out.,,,,,,
"We should help them, even if it will make things difficult for us here.",,,,,,
"Large-scale projects, like mass electrification or geoengineering schemes, will help provide the foundation for a better world.",,,,,,
"Just like with Research cards, swipe these up to scan them and add [initiative] infrastructure points.",,,,,,
Here you can turn [political_capital] political capital into [initiative] infrastructure points and use that to set build these projects.,,,,,,
People aren't happy with the way things are going...,,,,,,
...they're wrecking factories and laboratories in protest.,,,,,,
This will make your plans harder to implement...,,,,,,
Incredible. The greatest city our planet has ever known...,,,,,,
More like a vast networked ecology than anything designed by a human.,,,,,,
Seems more like a rat's nest to me...,,,,,,
The world was divided over your death...,,,,,,
"Some mourned the loss of someone with tremendous potential, while others cheered the death of a misguided tyrant.",,,,,,
And the anxious fear of a changing planet still haunted the world.,,,,,,
If only you could have done more...,,,,,,
We can't build homes on top of toxic land fills or near dangerous nuclear power plants.,,,,,,
We need to shift more quickly to renewable energy!,,,,,,
The ecofeminist movement is strong and will mobilize quickly against environmental injustices.,,,,,,
You're digging your own grave.,,,,,,
The Authoritarian is now a [nemesis] nemesis.,,,,,,
Without force we'll never save the planet.,,,,,,
Your plans mean nothing if you let people's ignorance and impulsiveness run loose.,,,,,,
It's for the best.,,,,,,
"Well, this is an upsetting milestone: ocean plastic weighs more than fish.",,,,,,
We still rely too heavily on fossil fuels and plastics!,,,,,,
Biodiversity has been plummeting...,,,,,,
"I don't know if it will work, but it's worth a try.",,,,,,
But there may be something we can try.,,,,,,
...in case the worst should come to pass.,,,,,,
I'm afraid that most of Earth's species will be lost forever.,,,,,,
It would have been better if we could have stopped extinctions from happening at all.,,,,,,
I propose a project to collect and store DNA samples of earth's remaining biodiversity...,,,,,,
Our reliance on hydropower as a major source of energy has meant the construction of several mega-dams across the world's waterways.,,,,,,
"As reservoirs fill, upstream forests are flooded, eliminating their function as carbon sinks.",,,,,,
"The dam constructed on the border between Paraguay and Brazil in the 1970s and 1980s, resulted in a 70 percent loss of biodiversity.",,,,,,
I for one am really impressed with our ability to shape natural environments and control water.,,,,,,
"I realize your intentions were good, but you just created more problems.",,,,,,
"We're able to produce quite a bit of power, but it has displaced millions of people and damaged ecosystems.",,,,,,
And they just contributed to climate change!,,,,,,
"And as the drowned vegetation decomposes, decaying plants in man-made reservoirs release methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.",,,,,,
"Aquatic species, particularly fish, are vulnerable to the impacts of dams.",,,,,,
There are many more birds than before because we have done so much to protect nature in recent years.,,,,,,
"I like yellowhammers, one of Rosa Luxemburg's favourite birds. What's your 'spark bird'?",,,,,,
There's been a spike in depression and similar mental health problems as of late.,,,,,,
Researchers are speculating that it has to do with the solar radiation management project...,,,,,,
living under a constant grey sky can't be good for one's mood.,,,,,,
Around the world many are marveling at the recovery of a once rare species.,,,,,,
I'm glad more people will be able to experience that.,,,,,,
You step back from your planning console and let out a sigh...,,,,,,
"Were they necessary, or did you just fumble your way through them?",,,,,,
You can't help but wonder how things could have gone differently.,,,,,,
Was this the only way?,,,,,,
So many unpopular and damaging decisions...,,,,,,
"You managed to last all this time, but how has everyone else fared?",,,,,,
..the weight of a decades-long career shedding from your shoulders.,,,,,,
Climate change has enabled boring insects and other tree parasites to expand their range.,,,,,,
"The trees look alive, but they're dying. This means more fire and carbon emissions...",,,,,,
"CO2 is denser than air, so the deadly cloud stayed long enough at ground level to kill two thousand people and countless animals within minutes.",,,,,,
"We try to store CO2 as safely as we can, but some accidents are inevitable. This will be bad for morale.",,,,,,
"For so long the polar bear was the mascot of our movement, and now it's gone...",,,,,,
We can't let all of these people move into countries that prepared better for these crises. It's their own fault they did not create resilient societies.,,,,,,
"If there were fewer people, perhaps we could lower emissions. I recommend you close borders and take harsher measures.",,,,,,
What are you talking about? We have to help everyone we can.,,,,,,
"I've followed your planning for some time now, and I see you have the interests of the world at heart.",,,,,,
"And by ""world"", I do mean the *whole* world, and not just the wealthy regions like some mean with that term.",,,,,,
My party is happy to join your coalition.,,,,,,
I hope that together we can undo at least some part of centuries of injustices.,,,,,,
The Fanonist is now an [ally] ally. The contentedness of lower and lower-middle income regions will recover more quickly.,,,,,,
We are tired of living under your reign of terror! Your time is up.,,,,,,
Prepare to die!,,,,,,
You ought to--,,,,,,
Models have long predicted that warming will increase hurricane strength.,,,,,,
Otherwise many places will become inhospitable.,,,,,,
We ought to do whatever we can to bring down the temperature to reduce this risk.,,,,,,
"Monsoons throughout the Indian subcontinent have been weaker and less frequent, disrupting a vital component of that region's climate.",,,,,,
Residents there are understandably upset and--,,,,,,
There must be alternatives that don't require sacrificing us!,,,,,,
"This is a terrible cost that we are made to bear, and we won't take it any longer!",,,,,,
I urge you to act soon. Others are talking of more aggressive ways of stopping the project.,,,,,,
