In the Arctic, caribou or reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) are the only large herbivores. With rising temperature, thermophilic plant species are invading the tundra and these are preferred by the herbivores. Therefore, reindeer and muskoxen are able to maintain the present vegetation composition even in a warmer climate [42]. Furthermore, they prevent woody plant encroachment with increasing temperatures, which in turn leads to a higher albedo [43], with a cooling effect. Large herbivores may increase soil carbon sequestration, when they consolidate the persistence of the permafrost \n\nhttps://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL036332\n\nDiscussed with Troy, merging this with the new Half-Earth policy -

At current rates of consumption, there may be between 130 and 230 years of recoverable uranium available globally. Derek Abbott, Professor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Adelaide, has calculated that scaling nuclear production up to meet global demand could leave just five years of uranium supplies.\" https://bostonreview.net/science-nature/samuel-miller-mcdonald-nuclear-power-our-best-bet-against-climate-change","opposers":["319e2a5a-1575-48f5-9ebe-bcda9c8224b4"],"output":"Electricity","resources":{"Electricity":0,"Fuel":0,"Land":0.000119,"Water":2.13666},"supporters":["a3012703-8776-4515-ac1b-f5d7ebec51cd"]},"1b4e1e5f-b269-401d-b41e-0c1cde0d36a6":{"_created":1634834069056,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":["dialogue"],"questions":[]},"arc":"Natural Disasters","dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"id":0,"next":[{"conditions":[],"id":"3573c4c8-8550-44e3-bf4f-25b554a280eb","line_id":"fb22371a-1822-495b-81b0-7ccd6e402d1f"}],"speaker":"The Analyst","text":""},"01854569-796d-4f10-84bd-2259ce699ce4":{"id":"01854569-796d-4f10-84bd-2259ce699ce4","next":null,"speaker":"Gossy","text":""},"62a0b7e4-a79e-485c-8145-811beba15197":{"id":"62a0b7e4-a79e-485c-8145-811beba15197","next":null,"speaker":"Gossy","text":""},"fb22371a-1822-495b-81b0-7ccd6e402d1f":{"id":"fb22371a-1822-495b-81b0-7ccd6e402d1f","next":[{"conditions":[],"id":"67a07df1-cb87-4409-ab2e-5d1cd3d2cc48","line_id":"01854569-796d-4f10-84bd-2259ce699ce4"}],"speaker":"Gossy","text":""}},"root":0},"effects":[{"entity":"2a2eb928-5a28-4155-a02a-c8c83cd38bba","id":"c7461cca-49c4-46a5-ae25-95a5fbe87bd9","params":{"Change":0},"subtype":"Emissions","type":"AddEvent"},{"entity":"149d9043-2ef0-42e7-b690-6d6b2e068749","id":"ec696568-2779-4830-aaa6-567881a08ae2","params":{"Change":0},"subtype":"Emissions","type":"AddEvent"}],"id":"1b4e1e5f-b269-401d-b41e-0c1cde0d36a6","image":{"attribution":"NIST School Shared Account (CC BY-SA 2.0)","image":"1635197160.644289.png","original":"1635197117.799415.jpg"},"locked":true,"name":"Severe Flooding -

We'll assume the latter for all biomass electricity, so that's 7.884kWh/m2 or 0.1268m2/kWh\n\nhttps://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Mekonnen-et-al-2015_1.pdf gives a water footprint of 48,000-500,000 m3/TJ net energy for firewood; going to be very crude and assume that all BECCS are using wood pellets and that firewood is equivalent to that. So say 274,000 m3/TJ or 986.4L/kWh\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513003856 gives the following EROIs:\n- Ethanol (sugarcane): 0.8 to 10\n- Corn-based ethanol: 0.8 to 1.6\n- Biodiesel: 1.3\nLet's say 5.4, or 0.185kWh/kWh, split between electricity and fuel.\n\nThis plant in the UK is supposed to capture 350tCO2/year while generating 300MWh/year: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/911268/potential-of-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture.pdf (from 1/2020) using 100% wood pellets (other figures I've found were for biomass/coal co-firing plants). This would be about 1166.67g CO2 sequestered/kWh\n\nAs for N2O emissions, assuming the biomass is grown similar to industrial agriculture, we have 0.0001473g N2O for our industrial ag crop process, and with the conversion of 860.421kcals/kWh we get about 0.12674g N2O/kWh from fertilizer application. The problem with this conversion is that with our industrial ag crop process we are only counting human-consumed kcals; in practice inedible parts of the plants are also burned for energy. So this figure is almost certainly an overestimate, maybe just hand wave and cut it into half to 0.06337gN2O/kWh.","opposers":["319e2a5a-1575-48f5-9ebe-bcda9c8224b4"],"output":"Electricity","resources":{"Electricity":0,"Fuel":0,"Land":0.1268,"Water":986.4}},"29000e37-1e51-4e93-b83c-bea18e3be814":{"_created":1639273979665,"_type":"Palette","colors":["#00ffd5","#184e2b","#bb72a0","#9a4260"],"id":"29000e37-1e51-4e93-b83c-bea18e3be814"},"2a2eb928-5a28-4155-a02a-c8c83cd38bba":{"_created":1634830844034,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"aspect":"Flood","effects":[],"icon":"flood__2","id":"2a2eb928-5a28-4155-a02a-c8c83cd38bba","intensity":2,"locked":true,"name":"Severe Flooding","probabilities":[{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","subtype":"Temperature","type":"WorldVariable","value":3}],"id":"0ca16dd7-0f52-450d-bb73-fc3842b936b9","type":"Likely"},{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","subtype":"Temperature","type":"WorldVariable","value":2.5}],"id":"306200c9-c4c7-4ae2-b7bf-c46886ccabfb","type":"Random"},{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","subtype":"Temperature","type":"WorldVariable","value":2}],"id":"f71ddc17-3a19-4925-822f-61942c4b4055","type":"Unlikely"},{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","subtype":"Temperature","type":"WorldVariable","value":1.5}],"id":"08a16bae-5b7e-46e8-8bef-65c85d709736","type":"Rare"}],"subphase":null,"type":"Icon"},"2ae6d71d-e2d7-4a81-aa65-e32808760a3f":{"_created":1633359492310,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":["dialogue"],"questions":[]},"arc":"A Sick, Sick World","choices":[{"condition":"","effects":[],"text":""},{"condition":"","effects":[],"text":""},{"condition":"","effects":[],"text":""},{"condition":"","effects":[],"text":""}],"description":"","dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"decision":false,"id":0,"next":"662c9a5e-ee57-44d4-b3cb-a8771f600cd4","speaker":"The Doctor","text":"There are reports of a major outbreak of a novel mosquito-borne disease."},"662c9a5e-ee57-44d4-b3cb-a8771f600cd4":{"id":"662c9a5e-ee57-44d4-b3cb-a8771f600cd4","next":null,"speaker":"The Ecologist","text":"Warmer temperatures have been a boon for mosquito populations..."}},"root":0},"effects":[{"entity":"adaf60ed-b995-4bfe-8d2a-13d7f5a21b90","id":"7bca1b9d-2fc0-4397-89a6-facf7692c245","params":{"Change":0},"subtype":"Emissions","type":"AddEvent"},{"id":"83831057-94e6-4f04-802f-7de7d6deacdf","params":{"Change":"-1"},"subtype":"Outlook","type":"WorldVariable"}],"id":"2ae6d71d-e2d7-4a81-aa65-e32808760a3f","image":{"attribution":"Tom (CC BY 2.0)","image":"1634964311.42025.png","original":"1634964304.152028.jpg"},"local":false,"locked":false,"name":"Mosquito Disease","probabilities":[{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","id":"9052d782-1996-42a3-aaf2-f43a4d6e16a8","subtype":"ExtinctionRate","type":"WorldVariable","value":60}],"id":"4daca5aa-ed45-4e01-96c0-3c17749f0b4b","type":"Random"},{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","id":"e93494c7-e986-4912-bd33-5cda91366512","subtype":"Temperature","type":"WorldVariable","value":1.5}],"id":"9920eda5-38eb-475a-90b9-f9d5d899cb56","type":"Random"}],"subphase":"Main","type":"World","variables":[]},"2c7035ac-0bb1-437e-94ea-3945ca4b92ae":{"_created":1635198180272,"_type":"Palette","colors":["#e9b96e","#6d56c6","#18063d","#048738","#e0cfb4","#87c4cb","#333333","#bdbdbd"],"id":"2c7035ac-0bb1-437e-94ea-3945ca4b92ae"},"2c9d895f-2621-4db8-b59d-d25035429030":{"_created":1633364541182,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":["dialogue"],"questions":[]},"arc":"We Have Visitors","choices":[{"condition":"","effects":[],"text":""},{"condition":"","effects":[],"text":""},{"condition":"","effects":[],"text":""},{"condition":"","effects":[],"text":""}],"description":"Reports of strange lights in the skies are coming in from all over the world.

A significant reduction in carbon footprint can be \nachieved by decarbonising the energy mix. In the (upstream) production of medium, \nreductions that can be achieved by decarbonisation are smaller because a part of the \ncarbon footprint there is caused by the agricultural production of the feedstock and \nchemicals used during production of the medium ingredients, which rely on heavy industrial \nprocesses, that are harder to decarbonise. Scaffolds (assumed in this study to be in the \nform of a hydrogel), equipment, wastewater treatment and HVAC of the facility make up a \nrelatively minor part of the carbon footprint (total of < 2%).\nSo aside from energy, the other main contributor to GHG emissions (more significant under the renewable scenario) is the medium's production: roughly 1.25kgCO2eq/kg\nConversion from kg to kcals:\nBeef sausage is about ~3400kcals/kg (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/746779/nutrients)\nPork sausage is about ~3200kcals/kg (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/746780/nutrients)\nChicken is about ~1500kcals/kg (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/331897/nutrients)\nSo say 2700kcals/kg on average\n\nThese figures then are:\nEnergy use: 57.1kWh/kg = 0.2kWh/kcal\nLand use: 1.8m2/kg = 0.00067m2/kcal\nWater use: 49litre/kg = 0.018litre/kcal\nNon-energy GHG emissions: 1.25kgCO2eq/kg =

A different LIC scaling rate is calculated for different resources--all industries are scaled based on material footprint, but household water consumption, electricity, fuel, and plant and animal calories have different scaling rates (see `Consts`).","resources":{"Electricity":266.8,"Fuel":666.58,"Land":0,"Water":10975.989104986089}},"cdb3e67a-375b-444e-940e-fe9b5ef28e74":{"_created":1633451221438,"_type":"Project","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"cost":10,"description":"Develop scalable and safe thorium reactors.","effects":[{"entity":"82f54fbe-7f34-4e90-a01c-1ea6d5035e23","id":"4cec8c95-16eb-4089-9202-e77da00dd836","params":{"Change":0},"subtype":"Emissions","type":"UnlocksProcess"}],"group":"Nuclear","id":"cdb3e67a-375b-444e-940e-fe9b5ef28e74","image":{"attribution":"ORNL (Public Domain)","image":"1636127381.360145.png","original":"1635539526.100987.jpg"},"locked":false,"name":"Thorium Reactor","notes":"Would get around uranium shortage\n\nSeems like the benefits from thorium are relatively low\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0096340212459125\n\nChina is interested in the tech. \n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02459-w\n\nSounds like it will blow up\n\nhttps://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20210912-why-china-is-developing-a-game-changing-thorium-fuelled-nuclear-re","outcomes":[{"effects":[],"id":"248d0bca-7c84-45b1-82e3-80aa84597d0b","probability":{"conditions":[],"id":"6e36f8b5-d251-4247-9289-0b50f5b54a8c","type":"Guaranteed"},"text":"We can now deploy thorium reactors, which use a far more abundant fuel and create far less radioactive waste."}],"type":"Research","upgrades":[{"cost":0,"effects":[],"id":"ecab8287-f237-47ab-b6f8-0d295e93bc5d"}]},"cfaacae5-9977-49cb-968e-1c9fe1a50879":{"_created":1636501005735,"_type":"Project","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"cost":10,"description":"Pump water from the ocean onto Antarctica to reduce melting rates.","effects":[{"id":"fbfae8ad-30e8-49b0-a9c8-88b7e6c43199","params":{"Change":"-0.003"},"subtype":"SeaLevelRiseRate","type":"WorldVariable"},{"id":"8f5e4bce-d588-48e6-a9f8-7ff1f5a70310","params":{"Change":"1.169e13"},"subtype":"Electricity","type":"DemandAmount"}],"flavor":"We can use wind farms on the Antarctic continent to create enough to pump enough water to mitigate the current three millimeter-per-year rise.","group":"Geoengineering","id":"cfaacae5-9977-49cb-968e-1c9fe1a50879","image":{"attribution":"Vincent van Zeijst (CC BY-SA 3.0)","image":"1637726929.418744.png","original":"1637726922.350038.JPG"},"locked":false,"name":"Antarctic Pumping","notes":"https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/7/203/2016/esd-7-203-2016.pdf\n\n\n\nWas mentioned in KSR's The Ministry for the Future\n\n\"The pumping energy required to elevate the potential energy of ocean water to mitigate the\ncurrently observed 3 mm yr\u22121 will exceed 7 % of the current global primary energy supply\"\n\n\"Mitigating the currently observed rate\n(Cazenave and Dieng, 2014) of \u223c 3 mm yr\u22121 is considered\nin comparison to the mitigation of 1 mm yr\u22121 and a rate of\n10 mm yr\u22121 within the \u201clikely range\u201d for the end of the cen-\ntury under the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 (IPCC, 2013)\"\n\n\" Solely in terms of throughput, mitigating\nsea-level rise of 3 mm yr\u22121 would require 90 of the largest\npump stations currently under construction in New Orleans,\neach assumed to pump \u223c 360 m3 s\u22121, which corresponds\nto \u223c 11 \u00d7 109 m3 yr\u22121 (Alyeska Pipeline Service Company,\n2013).

However, there is little\nscientific understanding of how global patterns of future urban\nexpansion will affect the world\u2019s cultivated areas. Here, we combine\nspatially explicit projections of urban expansion with datasets on\nglobal croplands and crop yields. Our results show that urban expansion will result in a 1.8\u20132.4% loss of global croplands by 2030,\nwith substantial regional disparities. About 80% of global cropland\nloss from urban expansion will take place in Asia and Africa. In both\nAsia and Africa, much of the cropland that will be lost is more than\ntwice as productive as national averages. Asia will experience the\nhighest absolute loss in cropland, whereas African countries will\nexperience the highest percentage loss of cropland. Globally, the\ncroplands that are likely to be lost were responsible for 3\u20134% of\nworldwide crop production in 2000. Urban expansion is expected to\ntake place on cropland that is 1.77 times more productive than the\nglobal average. The loss of cropland is likely to be accompanied by\nother sustainability risks and threatens livelihoods, with diverging\ncharacteristics for different megaurban regions.

Refrigerants","notes":"https://drawdown.org/solutions/alternative-refrigerants/technical-summary#\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/en-gtz-proklima-natural-refrigerants.pdf\n\"Implications of refrigerant choice\nRefrigerant choice is normally a function of several factors, some of which are propertybased and some of which are influenced by market issues.\nThe property-based factors include:\n\u2013 Global warming potential\n\u2013 Ozone depleting potential\n\u2013 Flammability\n\u2013 Toxicity\n\u2013 Chemical reactivity and material compatibility\n\u2013 Potential efficiency (thermo-physical properties)\nThe market issues are:\n\u2013 Refrigerant cost (per kg or per system charge)\n\u2013 Cost of components\n\u2013 Access to refrigerant\n\u2013 Availability of suitable components, oils, service equipment\n\u2013 Adequate expertise and training \"\n\n\nWe aren't modeling HFCs specifically (though hector supports it)\n\nThis report suggests that \"Reductions of between 210 and 460 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions can be delivered over the next four decades through actions to improve the cooling industry\u2019s energy efficiency together with the transition to climate-friendly refrigerants\"\nhttps://www.iea.org/news/climate-friendly-cooling-could-cut-years-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-save-trillions-of-dollars\nhttps://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/71c8db7e-1137-41ef-99c3-8f2c8d3a5d86/Cooling_Emissions_and_Policy_Synthesis_Report.pdf\n\nSo let's say that's like 8.375GtCO2eq annual emissions reduction\nThis is using best available technology in 2018; 3/4 of the emissions reduction is from energy efficient improvements, \"equivalent to an average 40% efficiency improvement.\"\n\nHFC-134a is the most common refrigerant with a GWP of 1360\nGlobal AC energy demand in 2016 was 2,000TWh; total of all cooling equipment in 2018 estimated to be 3900TWh\n\nSince we aren't modeling HFCs (as far as I can tell they are relatively insignificant in overall CO2eq emissions) we can just focus on the energy use of cooling, especially if energy efficiency makes up the bulk of those emissions improvements.\n\nWe're modeling \"buildings\" as one sector, so we don't have specifics on cooling energy usage. This is for NYC: https://qsel.columbia.edu/nycenergy/about.html but shows that cooling is a relatively small part of energy use. I imagine it's much higher for warmer climates.\n\nFor the US as a whole, https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=1174&t=1\n> The residential sector\u2019s electricity use for cooling was about 236 billion kWh in 2020, which was equal to about 16% of total residential sector electricity consumption and 6% of total U.S. electricity consumption.\n>\n> The commercial sector, which includes commercial and institutional buildings, used about 155 billion kWh for cooling in 2020, which was equal to about 12% of total commercial sector electricity consumption and 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption.\n\nSo making the really crude assumption that the US covers a wide enough range of climates that we can take these numbers to be representative of the whole world, let's say 14% of building electricity use in general is from cooling, and assume this research gives us 40% energy use efficiency on cooling, then this is roughly gives us an overall electricity use modifier of 0.96","outcomes":[{"effects":[],"id":"3e0fa3f3-fcd9-4038-9dbe-e58b5a97f2e6","probability":{"conditions":[],"id":"dfd7cfb8-900a-41dd-8369-d0dd95a5c4ae","type":"Guaranteed"},"text":"R-744 (Carbon dioxide, CO2) as the chosen natural refrigerant has lower efficiency."}],"type":"Research","upgrades":[]},"dd55877e-f782-4adb-af78-7715045db74e":{"_created":1633441812579,"_type":"Region","_validation":{"invalid":["outlook"],"questions":[]},"development":0.5,"health":63.1,"id":"dd55877e-f782-4adb-af78-7715045db74e","image":{"attribution":"Konstantin Krismer (Public Domain)","image":"1639493585.327401.png","original":"1636474310.525166.JPG"},"income_level":"Upper-Middle","latitude":"Tropic","name":"Caribbean","population":43977555},"dd581ada-708f-4c96-a8df-6867c103cfeb":{"_created":1636055987398,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":["dialogue"],"questions":[]},"arc":"","dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"decision":false,"id":0,"next":"f55a90e1-37ea-461a-b43d-3c8af77ec790","speaker":"The Citizen","text":"My neighbors and I got rid of our lawns and encouraged native grasses to grow instead."},"d1262c19-8849-4cd7-bf47-0c2dd396aef6":{"decision":false,"id":"d1262c19-8849-4cd7-bf47-0c2dd396aef6","next":"d8dd7b0d-6b1d-4bb6-b585-3e7ea590787d","speaker":"The Ecologist","text":"Vole and shrew populations have rebounded, as have wildflowers like lupine."},"d8dd7b0d-6b1d-4bb6-b585-3e7ea590787d":{"id":"d8dd7b0d-6b1d-4bb6-b585-3e7ea590787d","next":null,"speaker":"The Citizen","text":"We've grown to appreciate how much we can do for our local environment, even as we try to change the world."},"e81c7c1d-035f-47b7-8b3d-68c05d75b4d0":{"decision":false,"id":"e81c7c1d-035f-47b7-8b3d-68c05d75b4d0","next":"d1262c19-8849-4cd7-bf47-0c2dd396aef6","speaker":"The Ecologist","text":"These changes have brought a wealth of wildlife into our cities."},"f55a90e1-37ea-461a-b43d-3c8af77ec790":{"decision":false,"id":"f55a90e1-37ea-461a-b43d-3c8af77ec790","next":"e81c7c1d-035f-47b7-8b3d-68c05d75b4d0","speaker":"The Citizen","text":"We rewilded the local golf course.

Niel Mattson, professor of horticulture at Cornell University \"One of the things that we\u2019ve found is that if we look at like New York City, production in a greenhouse had very similar energy use and carbon footprint to growing in California and shipping 3000 miles. It was ever so slightly higher, but just a few percentage points higher than field production. However, a vertical farm had about twice the energy cost and twice the carbon footprint of growing 3000 miles away.\"\nhttps://gastropod.com/transcript-dig-for-victory/\n\nTV: for me, it seems that it trades fertilizer and water for electricity. Yet, it can only really apply to salad greens and the like and cannot replace more than 10-20percent of crops at most, and definitely can't be used for animal fodder.\n\n\nEnergy use:\n\n> For example, strawberries grown on a conventional farm in Chile require 0.4524 kiloWatt hours (kWh) of electricity per square metre per year (sq.m/year). Whereas strawberries grown on a vertical farm in Russia require over 3,000% more energy at 1,404 kWh/sq.m/year. To put that in context, a four-room HDB\u2019s average electricity consumption is 3.99 kWh/sq.m/year.\nhttps://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/nts/vertical-farms-are-they-sustainable/\n\nOther figures here (per m2): https://ifarm.fi/blog/2020/12/how-much-electricity-does-a-vertical-farm-consume\nRomaine lettuce: 65.26 kWh / Month\nRocket: 52.51 kWh / Month\nStrawberries: 117.10 kWh / Month (in fact, I think this is the Russian vertical farm referenced above)\n\nA major downside that's not really captured here is that vertical farming has a much more limited range of crops it can produce (most often leafy greens).\n\n\n\nOther values from here (Table 3): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7516583/\n\n    kg_to_kcal = 136\n    water_use = 1 # L/kg/year\n    energy_use = 250 # kWh/kg/year\n    co2_emissions = 158 # kg/ton\n    land_use = 100 # kg/m2, 80-120kg/m2\n\nPer Troy's suggestion to limit vertical farming output to 10-20% of current demand, the limit is set at 1026000000000000kcals (15% of starting in-game plant calorie demand).","opposers":["0d080b15-013d-410e-a12c-43dfc2011cf9","77429930-6697-4bb1-b8fb-7f2bd9626622"],"output":"PlantCalories","resources":{"Electricity":1.838,"Fuel":0,"Land":7.35e-05,"Water":0.0073529},"supporters":["3ea4a4b0-a708-477f-ab91-1d97905395e0","bc5ee8db-0738-4d2f-b451-06a88b44c3ce","d5a53150-efc0-488c-a054-3fc4e63671d9"]},"ece805b7-81a4-4d1d-8860-4ce4d00beec4":{"_created":1633441853050,"_type":"Region","_validation":{"invalid":["outlook"],"questions":[]},"development":0.31,"health":44.3,"id":"ece805b7-81a4-4d1d-8860-4ce4d00beec4","image":{"attribution":"Maarten van der Bent (CC BY-SA 2.0)","image":"1639493540.738693.png","original":"1636475170.000184.jpg"},"income_level":"Low","latitude":"Tropic","name":"Western Africa","population":423239061},"ed650dc0-fa48-4def-8a3d-57409f53ba62":{"_created":1633451958160,"_type":"Process","deleted":true,"features":{"UsesLivestock":false},"id":"ed650dc0-fa48-4def-8a3d-57409f53ba62","locked":false,"name":"Geothermal","output":"Electricity"},"ede2fc23-f714-4e48-914d-16a68bcd69f6":{"_created":1634838446359,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"aspect":"Force","dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"id":0,"next":null,"speaker":"Gossy","text":""}},"root":0},"effects":[],"icon":"attacks","id":"ede2fc23-f714-4e48-914d-16a68bcd69f6","intensity":1,"locked":true,"name":"Doom Cult Attacks","probabilities":[{"conditions":[{"comparator":"<=","id":"a1ccafc0-d1ee-45f0-ba84-9ff84883a630","subtype":"Outlook","type":"WorldVariable","value":20}],"id":"d395164e-e988-4567-8866-2347c2be95c0","type":"Random"}],"subphase":null,"type":"Icon"},"eefd8ee2-1bb9-4756-b24d-94c1741f8e35":{"_created":1633379891120,"_type":"Project","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"cost":10,"description":"Iron out some remaining technical issues for less complicated floating wind turbine installation and maintenance.","effects":[{"entity":"c576787c-860e-4798-9d31-85ff807a83ad","id":"10ff649c-5d8b-4689-a437-b8bf5e03385c","params":{"Change":0},"subtype":"Emissions","type":"UnlocksProcess"}],"flavor":"Expands area that can be used for wind-turbine deployment beyond land and near-shore to waters >60m deep.

Consequently, production costs would decrease (e.g., lower seed costs) and field management tasks would be reduced (Zhang et al., 2018a, Zhang et al., 2018b). By not disturbing the soil, perennial crops can favor soil biodiversity (McLaughlin and Mineau, 1995), providing, for example, additional niches for soil beetles (Burmeister, 2021). They allow the development of a more natural soil system and, presumably, with improved soil health, high drought resilience and long-term stability (Burmeister, 2021, Sanford et al., 2021). Additionally, considering the higher aboveground biomass production in perennial crops, the use of by-products such as mulch or husks can be increased (Fig. 2).","outcomes":[{"effects":[{"id":"4590586a-8e30-46ea-95be-310f09a391c4","params":{"Change":0,"Percent":""},"subtype":"ExtinctionRate","type":"WorldVariable"}],"id":"fcb480bf-eb60-4731-a6f0-1dabc3bb47bf","probability":{"conditions":[],"id":"29c4ee05-6e2a-4682-beff-642da7b5c051","type":"Guaranteed"},"text":"The deeply rooted wheatgrass Kernza (Thinopyrum intermedium) is the first to receive large scale distribution."}],"supporters":["d5a53150-efc0-488c-a054-3fc4e63671d9"],"type":"Research","upgrades":[]}}
