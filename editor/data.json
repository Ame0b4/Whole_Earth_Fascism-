In the Arctic, caribou or reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) are the only large herbivores. With rising temperature, thermophilic plant species are invading the tundra and these are preferred by the herbivores. Therefore, reindeer and muskoxen are able to maintain the present vegetation composition even in a warmer climate [42]. Furthermore, they prevent woody plant encroachment with increasing temperatures, which in turn leads to a higher albedo [43], with a cooling effect. Large herbivores may increase soil carbon sequestration, when they consolidate the persistence of the permafrost \n\nhttps://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL036332\n\nDiscussed with Troy, merging this with the new Half-Earth policy - FT","ongoing":true,"opposers":["3ea4a4b0-a708-477f-ab91-1d97905395e0"],"outcomes":[{"dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"id":0,"next":null,"speaker":"Gossy","text":"Reindeer in the Arctic are thriving and have increased soil carbon sequestration."}},"root":0},"effects":[{"hidden":false,"id":"80eafb4e-ddac-48e8-9491-6f76f5c1154c","params":{"Change":0},"subtype":"Emissions","type":"WorldVariable"}],"id":"375f3a2b-2ca2-43af-9c5f-b7a93e46d556","probability":{"conditions":[],"id":"91ca88d0-cbb8-460c-a77a-3ae01262ecf4","type":"Guaranteed"},"text":"The resilience of nature never ceases to surprise."}],"supporters":["319e2a5a-1575-48f5-9ebe-bcda9c8224b4","da99204f-ec99-432c-bb0f-de072b1006bb"],"type":"Initiative","upgrades":[]},"0631b696-1e92-451b-a202-a803f4da0067":{"_created":1646594671925,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"arc":"A Dying Planet","dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"decision":false,"id":0,"next":"93d96ad6-a193-4014-b3b5-38f8a7d09c6f","speaker":"The Ecofeminist","text":"A fungus has been spreading across Europe, killing 80% of ash trees."},"35fb26a2-6e72-4b8d-bc12-593ad345ff0b":{"id":"35fb26a2-6e72-4b8d-bc12-593ad345ff0b","next":null,"speaker":"The Ecofeminist","text":""},"4cf9e174-bf73-4be2-9c6a-9c257d6182e8":{"decision":false,"id":"4cf9e174-bf73-4be2-9c6a-9c257d6182e8","next":"94929a11-d496-40b9-88f8-73234cc4dfe0","speaker":"The Ecofeminist","text":"The pathogen was able to spread rapidly due to the industrialization of the nursery trade in Europe."},"93d96ad6-a193-4014-b3b5-38f8a7d09c6f":{"decision":true,"id":"93d96ad6-a193-4014-b3b5-38f8a7d09c6f","next":[{"_goto":true,"_original_line_id":"4cf9e174-bf73-4be2-9c6a-9c257d6182e8","conditions":[],"effects":[],"id":"5fbacc2c-1df7-438b-8a5e-eac000dad4db","line_id":"4cf9e174-bf73-4be2-9c6a-9c257d6182e8","text":"How did this happen??"}],"speaker":"The Ecofeminist","text":"This has had a catastrophic impact since ash trees are a keystone species\u2014insects, lichen, mollusks, and birds all rely on them."},"94929a11-d496-40b9-88f8-73234cc4dfe0":{"id":"94929a11-d496-40b9-88f8-73234cc4dfe0","next":null,"speaker":"The Ecofeminist","text":"Taking plants out of their native habitat and packing them in large quantities for container shipping is a recipe for the globalization of plant disease."}},"root":0},"effects":[{"hidden":false,"id":"d05df69c-0f6c-48ff-afe3-4f51eb283eb7","params":{"Change":"1"},"subtype":"ExtinctionRate","type":"WorldVariable"}],"id":"0631b696-1e92-451b-a202-a803f4da0067","image":{"attribution":"Food and Environment Research Agency, OGL v1.0OGL v1.0","image":"1646596459.841511.png","original":"1646596452.894368.jpg"},"locked":false,"name":"Ash Dieback","notes":"a chronic fungal disease of ash trees in Europe\nAsh dieback (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) is a fungus which originated in Asia.

At current rates of consumption, there may be between 130 and 230 years of recoverable uranium available globally. Derek Abbott, Professor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Adelaide, has calculated that scaling nuclear production up to meet global demand could leave just five years of uranium supplies.\" https://bostonreview.net/science-nature/samuel-miller-mcdonald-nuclear-power-our-best-bet-against-climate-change","opposers":["319e2a5a-1575-48f5-9ebe-bcda9c8224b4"],"output":"Electricity","resources":{"Electricity":0,"Fuel":0,"Land":0.000119,"Water":2.13666},"supporters":["99f2e26f-d040-42b1-a8fd-73bbaaa0c180","bc5ee8db-0738-4d2f-b451-06a88b44c3ce"]},"1b003c12-ccc9-4db5-8233-70cdd936379e":{"_created":1644696484600,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"arc":"Commentary","dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"id":0,"next":null,"speaker":"The Geoengineer","text":" Our inspiration for the second moon is a French artist, who imagined a necklace of mirrors circling the Earth to illuminate the nighttime streets of Paris with reflected sunshine."}},"root":0},"effects":[],"id":"1b003c12-ccc9-4db5-8233-70cdd936379e","locked":false,"name":"Commentary - Artificial Moons","notes":"It would be nice to track down this 'French artist', otherwise it's a bit maddening.

We'll assume the latter for all biomass electricity, so that's 7.884kWh/m2 or 0.1268m2/kWh\n\nhttps://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Mekonnen-et-al-2015_1.pdf gives a water footprint of 48,000-500,000 m3/TJ net energy for firewood; going to be very crude and assume that all BECCS are using wood pellets and that firewood is equivalent to that. So say 274,000 m3/TJ or 986.4L/kWh\n\nthis paper gives different numbers: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0812619106\n> For electricity, sugar beet, maize, and sugar cane are the most favorable crops [50 m3/gigajoule (GJ)]. Rapeseed and jatropha, typical energy crops, are disadvantageous (400 m3/GJ). For ethanol, sugar beet, and potato (60 and 100 m3/GJ) are the most advantageous, followed by sugar cane (110 m3/GJ); sorghum (400 m3/GJ) is the most unfavorable. For biodiesel, soybean and rapeseed show to be the most favorable WF (400 m3/GJ); jatropha has an adverse WF (600 m3/GJ).\nThese are all way, way lower than the firewood estimate. For BECCS we'll use 50m3/GJ (0.18L/kWh); for biofuels we'll use 80m3/GJ (0.29L/kWh).\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513003856 gives the following EROIs:\n- Ethanol (sugarcane): 0.8 to 10\n- Corn-based ethanol: 0.8 to 1.6\n- Biodiesel: 1.3\nLet's say 5.4, or 0.185kWh/kWh, split between electricity and fuel.\n\nThis plant in the UK is supposed to capture 350tCO2/year while generating 300MWh/year: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/911268/potential-of-bioenergy-with-carbon-capture.pdf (from 1/2020) using 100% wood pellets (other figures I've found were for biomass/coal co-firing plants). This would be about 1166.67g CO2 sequestered/kWh\n\nAs for N2O emissions, assuming the biomass is grown similar to industrial agriculture, we have 0.0001473g N2O for our industrial ag crop process, and with the conversion of 860.421kcals/kWh we get about 0.12674g N2O/kWh from fertilizer application. The problem with this conversion is that with our industrial ag crop process we are only counting human-consumed kcals; in practice inedible parts of the plants are also burned for energy. So this figure is almost certainly an overestimate, maybe just hand wave and cut it into half to 0.06337gN2O/kWh.","opposers":[],"output":"Electricity","resources":{"Electricity":0,"Fuel":0,"Land":0.1268,"Water":0.18},"supporters":[]},"29000e37-1e51-4e93-b83c-bea18e3be814":{"_created":1639273979665,"_type":"Palette","colors":["#00ffd5","#184e2b","#bb72a0","#9a4260"],"id":"29000e37-1e51-4e93-b83c-bea18e3be814"},"2a2eb928-5a28-4155-a02a-c8c83cd38bba":{"_created":1634830844034,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"aspect":"Flood","dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"id":0,"next":null,"speaker":"Gossy","text":""}},"root":0},"effects":[],"icon":"flood__2","id":"2a2eb928-5a28-4155-a02a-c8c83cd38bba","intensity":2,"locked":true,"name":"Severe Flooding","probabilities":[{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","subtype":"Temperature","type":"WorldVariable","value":3}],"id":"0ca16dd7-0f52-450d-bb73-fc3842b936b9","type":"Likely"},{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","subtype":"Temperature","type":"WorldVariable","value":2.5}],"id":"306200c9-c4c7-4ae2-b7bf-c46886ccabfb","type":"Random"},{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","subtype":"Temperature","type":"WorldVariable","value":2}],"id":"f71ddc17-3a19-4925-822f-61942c4b4055","type":"Unlikely"},{"conditions":[{"comparator":">=","subtype":"Temperature","type":"WorldVariable","value":1.5}],"id":"08a16bae-5b7e-46e8-8bef-65c85d709736","type":"Rare"}],"subphase":null,"type":"Icon"},"2a7e7b1b-377f-4b59-b277-3ab131125820":{"_created":1645541432104,"_type":"Project","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"cost":20,"description":"Research the use of viruses ('phages') to kill bacteria.

According to information shared in the local periodical The People's Daily, the moon, which would generate a \"dusk-like glow\", could light an area that covers a diameter ranging from 10-80 km (no doubt while reading this, some of our IE readerships has already begun picturing images of the Batman logo and the residents of Gotham City). \n\nWhat's more, the proposed second moon would shine 8 times brighter than the real moon, and most importantly from a logistical perspective, could be controlled within a significant range of at least a few dozen meters.  Part science, part stranger than fiction, the satellite offers promising possibilities, with Wu pointing to the original inspiration behind the glowing orb in the sky by referring to \"a French artist, who imagined hanging a necklace made of mirrors above the Earth which could reflect sunshine through the streets of Paris all year round\".","opposers":["319e2a5a-1575-48f5-9ebe-bcda9c8224b4","da99204f-ec99-432c-bb0f-de072b1006bb","f0aea937-7e4c-43a4-a07e-271aaddb17d2"],"outcomes":[{"dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"id":0,"next":null,"speaker":"The Geoengineer","text":"We have turned night into day!

A significant reduction in carbon footprint can be \nachieved by decarbonising the energy mix. In the (upstream) production of medium, \nreductions that can be achieved by decarbonisation are smaller because a part of the \ncarbon footprint there is caused by the agricultural production of the feedstock and \nchemicals used during production of the medium ingredients, which rely on heavy industrial \nprocesses, that are harder to decarbonise. Scaffolds (assumed in this study to be in the \nform of a hydrogel), equipment, wastewater treatment and HVAC of the facility make up a \nrelatively minor part of the carbon footprint (total of < 2%).\nSo aside from energy, the other main contributor to GHG emissions (more significant under the renewable scenario) is the medium's production: roughly 1.25kgCO2eq/kg\nConversion from kg to kcals:\nBeef sausage is about ~3400kcals/kg (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/746779/nutrients)\nPork sausage is about ~3200kcals/kg (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/746780/nutrients)\nChicken is about ~1500kcals/kg (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/331897/nutrients)\nSo say 2700kcals/kg on average\n\nThese figures then are:\nEnergy use: 57.1kWh/kg = 0.2kWh/kcal\nLand use: 1.8m2/kg = 0.00067m2/kcal\nWater use: 49litre/kg = 0.018litre/kcal\nNon-energy GHG emissions: 1.25kgCO2eq/kg = 1250.0gCO2eq/kg = 0.463gCO2eq/kcal","output":"AnimalCalories","resources":{"Electricity":0.2,"Fuel":0,"Land":0.00067,"Water":0.018},"supporters":["bc5ee8db-0738-4d2f-b451-06a88b44c3ce","f0aea937-7e4c-43a4-a07e-271aaddb17d2"]},"4e3efe6b-0cce-46b3-9dde-05c252ddbdff":{"_created":1633724324278,"_type":"Process","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"byproducts":{"Biodiversity":0,"CH4":1.07,"CO2":45.85,"N2O":0},"description":"Follows the same process as grey, with the additional technologies necessary to capture the CO2 produced when hydrogen is split from methane (or from coal) and store it for long term.","features":{"IsCCS":true,"IsCombustion":false,"IsFossil":true},"feedstock":"NaturalGas","feedstock_amount":0.1139,"id":"4e3efe6b-0cce-46b3-9dde-05c252ddbdff","image":{"attribution":"https://theconversation.com/carbon-capture-plant-turns-emissions-into-baking-soda-18847","image":"1648794284.076138.png","original":"1648794276.4081.jpg"},"locked":false,"mix_share":0,"name":"Blue Hydrogen","notes":"Methane and carbon dioxide emissions (averaged b/w with and w/o flue): https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ese3.956\nLand: calculated using fuel requirements and methane fuel efficiency below\nWater: pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsenergylett.1c01375\nFuel: sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319919300230\nElectricity: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920314136?via%3Dihub#s0105\n(We'll use the same values for water to conduct hydrolysis.)\nkWh/kg H2: https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2005/MichelleFung.shtml\n\nElsewhere I'm seeing EROI of 1:4 for grey/blue hydrogen (https://theconversation.com/blue-hydrogen-what-is-it-and-should-it-replace-natural-gas-166053), still not great, but 1:45 just seemed way too high -FT","output":"Fuel","resources":{"Electricity":0.034,"Fuel":4,"Land":0.0011786,"Water":0.27},"supporters":["da99204f-ec99-432c-bb0f-de072b1006bb"]},"4e638a48-8000-462c-b746-0c7ebd81e886":{"_created":1646525031130,"_type":"Project","_validation":{"invalid":["description","type","effects","cost","locked","group"],"questions":[]},"deleted":true,"id":"4e638a48-8000-462c-b746-0c7ebd81e886","locked":true,"name":"Seize the Means of Reproduction!

The book has 8.5kg CO2/yr/W which is about 970gCO2/kWh\n\nFor CH4 emissions, https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#sector-by-sector-where-do-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from says in 2016 1.9% of 49.4GtCO2eq was due to methane leakages from coal mining, which is 0.9386GtCO2eq or 0.026GtCH4 with a GWP of 36. According to IEA's Key World Energy Statistics 2018 (https://enerji.mmo.org.tr/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Key_World_energy-statistics-2018.pdf) in 2016 coal made up 28.1% of the world's primary energy supply of 13,647Mtoe (1.6e14kWh), so coal was 4.496e13 kWh, so about 0.57829g CH4/kWh\n\nFor EROI https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513003856 gives a range of 27-80 with a mean of 56.4 over the values provided, so about 0.0177kWh/kWh.

Natural gas made up 22.1% of energy, so about 3.536e13 kWh. Assuming that these each leak the same amount of CH4, we can assign about 59.07% of these emissions to oil production, giving us 0.0316Gt CH4 or about 0.6191g CH4/kWh.","opposers":["319e2a5a-1575-48f5-9ebe-bcda9c8224b4","da99204f-ec99-432c-bb0f-de072b1006bb"],"output":"Electricity","reqs":{"Land":0.00017562346329469617},"resources":{"Electricity":0,"Fuel":0,"Land":0.00017562346,"Water":3.68},"supporters":["3ea4a4b0-a708-477f-ab91-1d97905395e0"]},"ca75ad5b-48c9-4435-9338-6e6ab83c5e6d":{"_created":1644192731591,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"arc":"A Dying Planet","dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"decision":false,"id":0,"next":"46316151-6b0f-4f31-b070-0796d373fcd1","speaker":"The Ecologist","text":"Warmer waters are bad for most marine species.

However, there is little\nscientific understanding of how global patterns of future urban\nexpansion will affect the world\u2019s cultivated areas. Here, we combine\nspatially explicit projections of urban expansion with datasets on\nglobal croplands and crop yields. Our results show that urban expansion will result in a 1.8\u20132.4% loss of global croplands by 2030,\nwith substantial regional disparities. About 80% of global cropland\nloss from urban expansion will take place in Asia and Africa. In both\nAsia and Africa, much of the cropland that will be lost is more than\ntwice as productive as national averages. Asia will experience the\nhighest absolute loss in cropland, whereas African countries will\nexperience the highest percentage loss of cropland. Globally, the\ncroplands that are likely to be lost were responsible for 3\u20134% of\nworldwide crop production in 2000. Urban expansion is expected to\ntake place on cropland that is 1.77 times more productive than the\nglobal average.

of refrigerant choice\nRefrigerant choice is normally a function of several factors, some of which are propertybased and some of which are influenced by market issues.\nThe property-based factors include:\n\u2013 Global warming potential\n\u2013 Ozone depleting potential\n\u2013 Flammability\n\u2013 Toxicity\n\u2013 Chemical reactivity and material compatibility\n\u2013 Potential efficiency (thermo-physical properties)\nThe market issues are:\n\u2013 Refrigerant cost (per kg or per system charge)\n\u2013 Cost of components\n\u2013 Access to refrigerant\n\u2013 Availability of suitable components, oils, service equipment\n\u2013 Adequate expertise and training \"\n\n\nWe aren't modeling HFCs specifically (though hector supports it)\n\nThis report suggests that \"Reductions of between 210 and 460 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions can be delivered over the next four decades through actions to improve the cooling industry\u2019s energy efficiency together with the transition to climate-friendly refrigerants\"\nhttps://www.iea.org/news/climate-friendly-cooling-could-cut-years-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-save-trillions-of-dollars\nhttps://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/71c8db7e-1137-41ef-99c3-8f2c8d3a5d86/Cooling_Emissions_and_Policy_Synthesis_Report.pdf\n\nSo let's say that's like 8.375GtCO2eq annual emissions reduction\nThis is using best available technology in 2018; 3/4 of the emissions reduction is from energy efficient improvements, \"equivalent to an average 40% efficiency improvement.\"\n\nHFC-134a is the most common refrigerant with a GWP of 1360\nGlobal AC energy demand in 2016 was 2,000TWh; total of all cooling equipment in 2018 estimated to be 3900TWh\n\nSince we aren't modeling HFCs (as far as I can tell they are relatively insignificant in overall CO2eq emissions) we can just focus on the energy use of cooling, especially if energy efficiency makes up the bulk of those emissions improvements.\n\nWe're modeling \"buildings\" as one sector, so we don't have specifics on cooling energy usage. This is for NYC: https://qsel.columbia.edu/nycenergy/about.html but shows that cooling is a relatively small part of energy use. I imagine it's much higher for warmer climates.\n\nFor the US as a whole, https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=1174&t=1\n> The residential sector\u2019s electricity use for cooling was about 236 billion kWh in 2020, which was equal to about 16% of total residential sector electricity consumption and 6% of total U.S. electricity consumption.\n>\n> The commercial sector, which includes commercial and institutional buildings, used about 155 billion kWh for cooling in 2020, which was equal to about 12% of total commercial sector electricity consumption and 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption.\n\nSo making the really crude assumption that the US covers a wide enough range of climates that we can take these numbers to be representative of the whole world, let's say 14% of building electricity use in general is from cooling, and assume this research gives us 40% energy use efficiency on cooling, then this is roughly gives us an overall electricity use modifier of 0.96","opposers":[],"outcomes":[{"dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"decision":false,"id":0,"next":"a2775cb1-84c5-4d79-9f1a-99790306e9e6","speaker":"The Engineer","text":"We weren't able to find a refrigerant that checked off all the boxes..."},"a2775cb1-84c5-4d79-9f1a-99790306e9e6":{"decision":false,"id":"a2775cb1-84c5-4d79-9f1a-99790306e9e6","next":"e7b8df11-3618-4324-885a-80cf240c54a4","speaker":"The Engineer","text":"Some had health and safety risks, some were less efficient, some had further environmental issues or were themselves potent greenhouse gases..."},"d55a522a-517f-4b26-a661-c73a2c12797b":{"decision":false,"id":"d55a522a-517f-4b26-a661-c73a2c12797b","next":"e7b8df11-3618-4324-885a-80cf240c54a4","speaker":"The Engineer","text":""},"e6d10f63-467a-4438-a07c-c20ddc1da295":{"id":"e6d10f63-467a-4438-a07c-c20ddc1da295","next":null,"speaker":"The Engineer","text":"It's not the most efficient though."},"e7b8df11-3618-4324-885a-80cf240c54a4":{"decision":false,"id":"e7b8df11-3618-4324-885a-80cf240c54a4","next":"e6d10f63-467a-4438-a07c-c20ddc1da295","speaker":"The Engineer","text":"Though funnily enough, we settled on R-744 (carbon dioxide) as a natural refrigerant."}},"root":0},"effects":[],"id":"3e0fa3f3-fcd9-4038-9dbe-e58b5a97f2e6","probability":{"conditions":[],"id":"dfd7cfb8-900a-41dd-8369-d0dd95a5c4ae","type":"Guaranteed"},"text":"R-744 (Carbon dioxide, CO2) as the chosen natural refrigerant has lower efficiency."}],"supporters":["da99204f-ec99-432c-bb0f-de072b1006bb"],"type":"Research","upgrades":[]},"dd55877e-f782-4adb-af78-7715045db74e":{"_created":1633441812579,"_type":"Region","_validation":{"invalid":["outlook"],"questions":[]},"development":0.5,"health":63.1,"id":"dd55877e-f782-4adb-af78-7715045db74e","image":{"attribution":"Konstantin Krismer (Public Domain)","image":"1646301300.241242.png","original":"1636474310.525166.JPG"},"income_level":"Upper-Middle","latitude":"Tropic","name":"Caribbean","population":43977555},"dd581ada-708f-4c96-a8df-6867c103cfeb":{"_created":1636055987398,"_type":"Event","_validation":{"invalid":[],"questions":[]},"arc":"A New Life","dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"decision":false,"id":0,"next":"e81c7c1d-035f-47b7-8b3d-68c05d75b4d0","speaker":"The Citizen","text":"My neighbors and I got rid of our lawns and encouraged native grasses to grow instead."},"d1262c19-8849-4cd7-bf47-0c2dd396aef6":{"decision":false,"id":"d1262c19-8849-4cd7-bf47-0c2dd396aef6","next":null,"speaker":"The Ecologist","text":"Vole and shrew populations have rebounded, as have wildflowers like lupine (my favorite)."},"d8dd7b0d-6b1d-4bb6-b585-3e7ea590787d":{"id":"d8dd7b0d-6b1d-4bb6-b585-3e7ea590787d","next":null,"speaker":"The Citizen","text":"I've grown to appreciate how much we can do for our local environment, even as we try to change the world."},"e81c7c1d-035f-47b7-8b3d-68c05d75b4d0":{"decision":false,"id":"e81c7c1d-035f-47b7-8b3d-68c05d75b4d0","next":null,"speaker":"The Ecologist","text":"Beautiful.

It was ever so slightly higher, but just a few percentage points higher than field production. However, a vertical farm had about twice the energy cost and twice the carbon footprint of growing 3000 miles away.\"\nhttps://gastropod.com/transcript-dig-for-victory/\n\nTV: for me, it seems that it trades fertilizer and water for electricity. Yet, it can only really apply to salad greens and the like and cannot replace more than 10-20percent of crops at most, and definitely can't be used for animal fodder.\n\n\nEnergy use:\n\n> For example, strawberries grown on a conventional farm in Chile require 0.4524 kiloWatt hours (kWh) of electricity per square metre per year (sq.m/year). Whereas strawberries grown on a vertical farm in Russia require over 3,000% more energy at 1,404 kWh/sq.m/year. To put that in context, a four-room HDB\u2019s average electricity consumption is 3.99 kWh/sq.m/year.\nhttps://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/nts/vertical-farms-are-they-sustainable/\n\nOther figures here (per m2): https://ifarm.fi/blog/2020/12/how-much-electricity-does-a-vertical-farm-consume\nRomaine lettuce: 65.26 kWh / Month\nRocket: 52.51 kWh / Month\nStrawberries: 117.10 kWh / Month (in fact, I think this is the Russian vertical farm referenced above)\n\nA major downside that's not really captured here is that vertical farming has a much more limited range of crops it can produce (most often leafy greens).\n\n\n\nOther values from here (Table 3): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7516583/\n\n    water_use = 1 # L/kg/year\n    energy_use = 250 # kWh/kg/year\n    co2_emissions = 158 # kg/ton\n    land_use = 100 # kg/m2, 80-120kg/m2\n\n15kcal/100g of green lettuce, which gives us 15kcal/100g * 1000g/1kg * 1kg/250kWh = 0.6kcal/1kWh = 1.67kWh/kcal\n\nFor \"traditional/outdoor\" farming they give 0.3kWh/kg/year, which, using the same numbers, gives (15/100)*(1000/0.3) = 500, so 1/500 = 0.002kWh/kcal, which is also substantially higher than what we have for industrial plant calorie agriculture (about 0.0001kWh/kcal, so about 20x higher). We could fudge the number to scale the vertical farming estimate down by 20x, but that wouldn't really change much.\n\nPer Troy's suggestion to limit vertical farming output to 10-20% of current demand, the limit is set at 1026000000000000kcals (15% of starting in-game plant calorie demand).\n\nFurther reducing to 684000000000000kcals (10% of starting demand) b/c energy usage is so high that the player instantly loses. I think this will happen even at 5 or 10% of demand though. - FT","opposers":[],"output":"PlantCalories","resources":{"Electricity":0.0167,"Fuel":0,"Land":7.35e-05,"Water":0.0073529},"supporters":["bc5ee8db-0738-4d2f-b451-06a88b44c3ce"]},"eb68f0fc-788c-4740-8a93-f95b6054c76f":{"_created":1645484855188,"_type":"Project","_validation":{"invalid":["description","cost","outcomes"],"questions":[]},"deleted":true,"group":"Other","id":"eb68f0fc-788c-4740-8a93-f95b6054c76f","locked":true,"name":"5th Dimension","opposers":["da99204f-ec99-432c-bb0f-de072b1006bb"],"outcomes":[{"dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"id":0,"next":null,"speaker":"The Geoengineer","text":"A potentially great solution to our challenges on Earth!"}},"root":0},"effects":[],"id":"9b8fb685-7c7b-480d-8f63-ca2e68776c22","probability":{"conditions":[],"id":"e43b8864-af29-4a13-a9b4-4f84db0959f8","type":"Random"}},{"dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"id":0,"next":null,"speaker":"The Posadist","text":"Ah yes, the 5th dimension.

Consequently, production costs would decrease (e.g., lower seed costs) and field management tasks would be reduced (Zhang et al., 2018a, Zhang et al., 2018b). By not disturbing the soil, perennial crops can favor soil biodiversity (McLaughlin and Mineau, 1995), providing, for example, additional niches for soil beetles (Burmeister, 2021). They allow the development of a more natural soil system and, presumably, with improved soil health, high drought resilience and long-term stability (Burmeister, 2021, Sanford et al., 2021). Additionally, considering the higher aboveground biomass production in perennial crops, the use of by-products such as mulch or husks can be increased (Fig. 2).","opposers":[],"outcomes":[{"dialogue":{"lines":{"0":{"decision":false,"id":0,"next":"b39a5744-f603-473c-a651-bd944fff2e34","speaker":"The Farmer","text":"I love these new perennials...saves me a lot of work."},"b39a5744-f603-473c-a651-bd944fff2e34":{"decision":false,"id":"b39a5744-f603-473c-a651-bd944fff2e34","next":"c400583e-1ff1-4de5-863e-da91bcceb309","speaker":"The Farmer","text":"Don't need to worry about replanting them every year, or messing up my soil..."},"c400583e-1ff1-4de5-863e-da91bcceb309":{"id":"c400583e-1ff1-4de5-863e-da91bcceb309","next":null,"speaker":"The Farmer","text":"Any change where I have to work less is a welcome one."}},"root":0},"effects":[],"id":"fcb480bf-eb60-4731-a6f0-1dabc3bb47bf","probability":{"conditions":[],"id":"29c4ee05-6e2a-4682-beff-642da7b5c051","type":"Guaranteed"},"text":"The deeply rooted wheatgrass Kernza (Thinopyrum intermedium) is the first to receive large scale distribution."}],"supporters":["77429930-6697-4bb1-b8fb-7f2bd9626622"],"type":"Research","upgrades":[]}}
