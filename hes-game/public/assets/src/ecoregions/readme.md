This generates a PNG of biome labels for the world.

The biomes are:

- Tundra
- Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests
- Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands & Scrub
- Deserts & Xeric Shrublands
- Temperate Grasslands, Savannas & Shrublands
- Boreal Forests/Taiga
- Temperate Conifer Forests
- Temperate Broadleaf & Mixed Forests
- Montane Grasslands & Shrublands
- Mangroves
- Flooded Grasslands & Savannas
- Tropical & Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas & Shrublands
- Tropical & Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests
- Tropical & Subtropical Coniferous Forests
- N/A (Rock and Ice)

We aren't using these labels at the moment, instead we are using the ones generated by the `landuse` folder.
